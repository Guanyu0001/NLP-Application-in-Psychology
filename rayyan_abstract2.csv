"1","PIETERS S, 2018, ","THIS PAPER SHARES BEST PRACTICES FOR CRISIS MANAGERS AND ADVISERS, WITH A FOCUS ON CRISIS COMMUNICATION. THESE APPROACHES ARE BASED ON COLLECTING, GENERATING AND ANALYSING RELEVANT REAL-TIME DATA. AFTER INTRODUCING THE CONCEPT OF DATA-DRIVEN CRISIS STRATEGIES, THE PAPER DESCRIBES HOW CONTINUOUS SENTIMENT ANALYSIS CAN BE USED TO TAP INTO INFORMAL CONVERSATIONS ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND OTHER SOURCES. THE PAPER DEMONSTRATES HOW THIS CAN STIMULATE AND IMPROVE STRATEGIC THINKING, RESULTING IN A FAR MORE EFFECTIVE RESPONSE TO A CRISIS SITUATION. USING REAL-LIFE EXAMPLES, THE PAPER DEMONSTRATES HOW SUCH ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES CAN DELIVER HIGH-IMPACT CRISIS COMMUNICATION THAT TRULY ADDRESSES STAKEHOLDER NEEDS, ESPECIALLY COMPARED WITH TRADITIONAL PUBLIC RELATIONS APPROACHES. THE PAPER DESCRIBES SEVERAL COMMON METHODOLOGIES THAT ARE BUILT UPON THESE TECHNIQUES, WITH PARTICULAR FOCUS ON CRISIS COMMUNICATION. FINALLY, THE AUTHORS EXPLAIN STIJN PIETERS HOW ENRICHING SITUATIONAL INFORMATION BASED ON DATA COLLECTED IN THE INFORMAL SPHERE IS INVALUABLE IN A CRISIS. INDEED, ACCURATE INFORMATION CAN ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE DECISION-MAKING RELATED TO OTHER CRISIS MANAGEMENT DISCIPLINES. A NEW APPROACH TO DATA-DRIVEN AND EVIDENCEBASED CRISIS MANAGEMENT IS INTRODUCED, KNOWN AS 'CRISIS INTELLIGENCE'. THE AUTHORS PROPOSE A MODEL - THE CRISIS INTELLIGENCE WORK PROCESS - AS A FRAMEWORK FOR THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF WORK IN THIS AREA.",0,1,0

HOWEVER, IN SUCH A DISINTERMEDIATED ENVIRONMENT MISINFORMATION IS PERVASIVE AND ATTEMPTS TO DEBUNK ARE OFTEN UNDERTAKEN TO CONTRAST THIS TREND. IN THIS WORK, WE EXAMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DEBUNKING ON FACEBOOK THROUGH A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF 54 MILLION USERS OVER A TIME SPAN OF FIVE YEARS (JAN 2010, DEC 2014). IN PARTICULAR, WE COMPARE HOW USERS USUALLY CONSUMING PROVEN (SCIENTIFIC) AND UNSUBSTANTIATED (CONSPIRACY-LIKE) INFORMATION ON FACEBOOK US INTERACT WITH SPECIFIC DEBUNKING POSTS. OUR FINDINGS CONFIRM THE EXISTENCE OF ECHO CHAMBERS WHERE USERS INTERACT PRIMARILY WITH EITHER CONSPIRACY-LIKE OR SCIENTIFIC PAGES. HOWEVER, BOTH GROUPS INTERACT SIMILARLY WITH THE INFORMATION WITHIN THEIR ECHO CHAMBER. THEN, WE MEASURE HOW USERS FROM BOTH ECHO CHAMBERS INTERACTED WITH 50,220 DEBUNKING POSTS ACCOUNTING FOR BOTH USERS CONSUMPTION PATTERNS AND THE SENTIMENT EXPRESSED IN THEIR COMMENTS. SENTIMENT ANALYSIS REVEALS A DOMINANT NEGATIVITY IN THE COMMENTS TO DEBUNKING POSTS. FURTHERMORE, SUCH POSTS REMAIN MAINLY CONFINED TO THE SCIENTIFIC ECHO CHAMBER. ONLY FEW CONSPIRACY USERS ENGAGE WITH CORRECTIONS AND THEIR LIKING AND COMMENTING RATES ON CONSPIRACY POSTS INCREASES AFTER THE INTERACTION.",0,1,1
"3","LN P, 2019, ","BACKGROUND: ADVANCES IN SOCIAL TECHNOLOGIES OFFER NEW TOOLS FOR LARGE SCALE DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS OF PEER INFLUENCE AND SOCIAL NETWORKS ON SUBSTANCE USE ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIORS. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE IF TEXT MESSAGE CONTENT CAN PREDICT ALCOHOL AND MARIJUANA USE ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIORS. METHODS: TEXT MESSAGES FROM 91 MALES AGES 18-25 WERE MONITORED OVER A PERIOD OF 6 MONTHS AND EXAMINED FOR CONTENT RELATED TO ALCOHOL AND MARIJUANA. SELF-REPORT DATA INDICATING ALCOHOL AND MARIJUANA USE ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIORS WERE USED TO DETERMINE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN TEXT MESSAGE CONTENT, SOCIAL NETWORK STRUCTURE, AND SUBSTANCE USE ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIORS. RESULTS: IN TOTAL, 23,173 TEXT MESSAGES WERE ANALYZED WITH 166 TEXT MESSAGES INCLUDING ALCOHOL RELATED TERMS AND 195 TEXT MESSAGES INCLUDING DRUG RELATED TERMS. INDIVIDUALS WHO SENT TEXT MESSAGES RELATED TO ALCOHOL USE WERE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE PROBLEM ALCOHOL USE AND POSITIVE ATTITUDES TOWARD ALCOHOL USE, AND INDIVIDUALS WHO SENT TEXT MESSAGES RELATED TO MARIJUANA USE REPORTED HIGHER FREQUENCY OF MARIJUANA USE AND MORE POSITIVE ATTITUDES TOWARD MARIJUANA USE. INDIVIDUALS WITH MULTIPLE DAILY MARIJUANA USE WERE IN POSITIONS THAT HAD LESS CONTROL OVER NETWORK STRUCTURE. CONCLUSIONS: THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY INDICATE THAT MONITORING TEXT MESSAGE CONTENT AND SOCIAL NETWORK STRUCTURE AMONG EMERGING ADULT MALES CAN POTENTIALLY PREDICT ALCOHOL AND MARIJUANA USE ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIORS. TEXT MESSAGE CONTENT ANALYSIS IS A NOVEL TECHNIQUE INCREASING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE OF PEER INFLUENCE AND SOCIAL NETWORK ON SUBSTANCE USE ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIORS.",1,1,1
"4","QW D, 2006, ","MOTIVATION: REMOTE HOMOLOGY DETECTION BETWEEN PROTEIN SEQUENCES IS A CENTRAL PROBLEM IN COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY. THE DISCRIMINATIVE METHOD SUCH AS THE SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM) IS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE METHODS. MANY OF THE SVM-BASED METHODS FOCUS ON FINDING USEFUL REPRESENTATIONS OF PROTEIN SEQUENCE, USING EITHER EXPLICIT FEATURE VECTOR REPRESENTATIONS OR KERNEL FUNCTIONS. SUCH REPRESENTATIONS MAY SUFFER FROM THE PEAKING PHENOMENON IN MANY MACHINE-LEARNING METHODS BECAUSE THE FEATURES ARE USUALLY VERY LARGE AND NOISE DATA MAY BE INTRODUCED. BASED ON THESE OBSERVATIONS, THIS RESEARCH FOCUSES ON FEATURE EXTRACTION AND EFFICIENT REPRESENTATION OF PROTEIN VECTORS FOR SVM PROTEIN CLASSIFICATION. RESULTS: IN THIS STUDY, A LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS (LSA) MODEL, WHICH IS AN EFFICIENT FEATURE EXTRACTION TECHNIQUE FROM NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING, HAS BEEN INTRODUCED IN PROTEIN REMOTE HOMOLOGY DETECTION. SEVERAL BASIC BUILDING BLOCKS OF PROTEIN SEQUENCES HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED AS THE 'WORDS' OF 'PROTEIN SEQUENCE LANGUAGE', INCLUDING N-GRAMS, PATTERNS AND MOTIFS. EACH PROTEIN SEQUENCE IS TAKEN AS A 'DOCUMENT' THAT IS COMPOSED OF BAGS-OF-WORD. THE WORD-DOCUMENT MATRIX IS CONSTRUCTED FIRST. THE LSA IS PERFORMED ON THE MATRIX TO PRODUCE THE LATENT SEMANTIC REPRESENTATION VECTORS OF PROTEIN SEQUENCES, LEADING TO NOISE-REMOVAL AND SMART DESCRIPTION OF PROTEIN SEQUENCES. THE LATENT SEMANTIC REPRESENTATION VECTORS ARE THEN EVALUATED BY SVM. THE METHOD IS TESTED ON THE SCOP 1.53 DATABASE. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE LSA MODEL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES THE PERFORMANCE OF REMOTE HOMOLOGY DETECTION IN COMPARISON WITH THE BASIC FORMALISMS. FURTHERMORE, THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS METHOD IS COMPARABLE WITH THAT OF THE COMPLEX KERNEL METHODS SUCH AS SVM-LA AND BETTER THAN THAT OF OTHER SEQUENCE-BASED METHODS SUCH AS PSI-BLAST AND SVM-PAIRWISE.",0,1,0
"5","YANG M, 2019, ","TEXT CLASSIFICATION HAS BEEN ATTRACTING INCREASING ATTENTION WITH THE GROWTH OF TEXTUAL DATA CREATED ON THE INTERNET. GREAT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE BY DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS FOR DOMAINS WHERE A LARGE AMOUNT OF LABELED TRAINING DATA IS AVAILABLE. HOWEVER, PROVIDING SUFFICIENT DATA IS TIME-CONSUMING AND LABOR-INTENSIVE, ESTABLISHING SUBSTANTIAL OBSTACLES FOR EXPANDING THE LEARNED MODELS TO NEW DOMAINS OR NEW TASKS. IN THIS PAPER, WE INVESTIGATE THE TRANSFERRING CAPABILITY OF CAPSULE NETWORKS FOR TEXT CLASSIFICATION. CAPSULE NETWORKS ARE ABLE TO CAPTURE THE INTRINSIC SPATIAL PART-WHOLE RELATIONSHIP CONSTITUTING DOMAIN INVARIANT KNOWLEDGE THAT BRIDGES THE KNOWLEDGE GAP BETWEEN THE SOURCE AND TARGET DOMAINS (OR TASKS). WE PROPOSE AN ITERATIVE ADAPTATION STRATEGY FOR CROSS-DOMAIN TEXT CLASSIFICATION, WHICH ADAPTS THE SOURCE DOMAIN TO THE TARGET DOMAIN. A FAST TRAINING METHOD WITH CAPSULE COMPRESSION AND CLASS-GUIDED ROUTING IS DESIGNED TO MAKE THE CAPSULE NETWORK MORE EFFICIENT IN COMPUTATION FOR CROSS-DOMAIN TEXT CLASSIFICATION. WE FIRST CONDUCT EXPERIMENTS TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CAPSULE NETWORK ON SIX BENCHMARK DATASETS FOR GENERIC TEXT CLASSIFICATION. THE CAPSULE NETWORKS OUTPERFORM THE COMPARED MODELS ON 4 OUT OF 6 DATASETS, SUGGESTING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CAPSULE NETWORKS FOR TEXT CLASSIFICATION. MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE DEMONSTRATE THE TRANSFERRING CAPABILITY OF THE PROPOSED CROSS-DOMAIN CAPSULE NETWORK (TL-CAPSULE) BY APPLYING IT TO TWO TRANSFER LEARNING APPLICATIONS: SINGLE-LABEL TO MULTI-LABEL TEXT CLASSIFICATION AND CROSS-DOMAIN SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT CAPSULE NETWORKS CONSISTENTLY AND SUBSTANTIALLY OUTPERFORM THE COMPARED METHODS FOR BOTH TASKS. TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, THIS IS THE FIRST WORK THAT EMPIRICALLY INVESTIGATES THE TRANSFERRING CAPABILITY OF CAPSULE NETWORKS FOR TEXT MODELING.

FOR A SUCCESSFUL APPLICATION OF THE TEXT MINING PROCESS, THE TEXT REPRESENTATION ADOPTED MUST KEEP THE INTERESTING PATTERNS TO BE DISCOVERED. ALTHOUGH COMPETITIVE RESULTS FOR AUTOMATIC TEXT CLASSIFICATION MAY BE ACHIEVED WITH TRADITIONAL BAG OF WORDS, SUCH REPRESENTATION MODEL CANNOT PROVIDE SATISFACTORY CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCES ON HARD SETTINGS WHERE RICHER TEXT REPRESENTATIONS ARE REQUIRED. IN THIS PAPER, WE PRESENT AN APPROACH TO REPRESENT DOCUMENT COLLECTIONS BASED ON EMBEDDED REPRESENTATIONS OF WORDS AND WORD SENSES. WE BRING TOGETHER THE POWER OF WORD SENSE DISAMBIGUATION AND THE SEMANTIC RICHNESS OF WORD- AND WORD-SENSE EMBEDDED VECTORS TO CONSTRUCT EMBEDDED REPRESENTATIONS OF DOCUMENT COLLECTIONS. OUR APPROACH RESULTS IN SEMANTICALLY ENHANCED AND LOW-DIMENSIONAL REPRESENTATIONS. WE OVERCOME THE LACK OF INTERPRETABILITY OF EMBEDDED VECTORS, WHICH IS A DRAWBACK OF THIS KIND OF REPRESENTATION, WITH THE USE OF WORD SENSE EMBEDDED VECTORS. MOREOVER, THE EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION INDICATES THAT THE USE OF THE PROPOSED REPRESENTATIONS PROVIDES STABLE CLASSIFIERS WITH STRONG QUANTITATIVE RESULTS, ESPECIALLY IN SEMANTICALLY-COMPLEX CLASSIFICATION SCENARIOS.

IT HAS BEEN CLAIMED THAT INTONATION DOES NOT FACILITATE RECALL OVER AND ABOVE THE EFFECT ACHIEVED BY PAUSES. THIS MAY BE RELATED TO THE FACT THAT PAST RESEARCH HAS USED SYNTHESIZED INTONATION CONTOURS. IN THIS REPLICATION STUDY, WE SHOW THAT INTONATION DOES PROVIDE BENEFITS ONCE MORE NATURALISTIC INTONATION CONTOURS ARE USED. THIS BENEFIT IS INDEPENDENT OF RESPONSE MODALITY (SPOKEN RESPONSES, KEYBOARD RESPONSES, OR HANDWRITTEN RESPONSES IN A GRID). WE FURTHERMORE SHOW THAT INTONATION DIFFERENTIALLY AFFECTS SPECIFIC POSITIONS WITHIN THE SEQUENCE OF DIGITS.

SO FAR, RESEARCH HAS NEGLECTED THE SEARCH FOR A MEASURE ADEQUATELY CONSIDERING EMOTIONAL-BASED JOINT INTERACTIONS. THANKS TO A NETNOGRAPHIC SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF 7605 BRAND-USERS INTERACTIONS RETRIEVED FROM 18 TWITTER BRAND PROFILES, THIS PAPER ADVANCES KNOWLEDGE ON BRAND CO-CREATION AND INTRODUCES A NEW CONCEPT IN THE MARKETING DOMAIN, THE CO-CREATED EMOTIONAL VALUE OF THE BRAND, OPERATIONALISED THROUGH THE EMOTIONAL CO-CREATION SCORE (ECCS). THE PAPER REVEALS THAT DIFFERENT EMOTIONAL EXPERIENTIAL PATHS CAN BE GENERATED BY THE SIMULTANEOUS INTERACTION BETWEEN THE BRAND AND ITS CONSUMERS. IN PARTICULAR, IT SHOWS THAT SOME SECTORS CO-CREATE MORE THAN OTHERS. FURTHERMORE, BRANDS PROVIDE MORE POSITIVE EMOTIONS THAN CONSUMERS AND, WHEN DEALING WITH CONSUMERS EXTREME POLAR EMOTIONS, THEY COMPENSATE CONSUMERS EMOTIONS BY CALIBRATING THE ECCS, WHICH IS NOT INFLUENCED BY THE FREQUENCY OF LIKES, AND ONLY MARGINALLY INFLUENCED BY THE FREQUENCY OF INTERACTIONS.

RECENTLY, THE RISE OF ONLINE ECOSYSTEMS HAS FUELED THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PURCHASING-DECISION PREDICTION MODELS (PDPM) BASED ON THE SHARED OPINIONS, CONCERNS, AND EXPECTATIONS OF CUSTOMERS. COMMONLY, THESE PDPMS ARE CONSTRUCTED AS MULTIPLE CRITERIA DECISION ANALYSIS (MCDA) METHODS, WHERE EXPERTS ASCERTAIN THE CONSUMER'S PURCHASING CRITERIA, AS WELL AS THE IMPORTANCE OF THEM, BY MEANS OF SURVEYS AND THEIR OWN EXPERIENCE. ALTHOUGH RELYING ON EXPERTS MAY BE APPROPRIATE FOR IDENTIFYING CRITERIA, THIS APPROACH IS NOT SUITABLE FOR ASSESSING THE IMPORTANCE OF SAID CRITERIA DUE TO THE LARGE VOLUME OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON THE WEB. FURTHERMORE, THE PREFERENCES OF CONSUMERS IN ONLINE ECOSYSTEMS EVOLVE CONSTANTLY. IN THIS REGARD, WE CONSIDER THAT THE INFORMATION ABOUT PURCHASE-CRITERIA IMPORTANCE SHOULD BE DERIVED EXCLUSIVELY FROM THE OPINIONS OF CONSUMERS. HOWEVER, THE ATTITUDE AND THOUGHT-PROCESS LEADING TO PURCHASES CONTAIN INHERENT RELATIONSHIPS THAT CONSUMERS ARE NOT ABLE TO EXPRESS EXPLICITLY; CONSEQUENTLY, WE EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY TO MAKE USE OF THE SYNERGIES BETWEEN CRITERIA ALONG USER PREFERENCES. THIS PAPER PROPOSES A NEW PDPM THAT ESTIMATES THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CRITERIA AND VALUES THE ALTERNATIVES BY ONLY CONSIDERING THE OPINIONS EXPRESSED BY CONSUMERS IN DIGITAL ECOSYSTEMS, WHILE USING AN EXPERT-DEFINED SET OF CRITERIA.

SUCH INTERVENTIONS REQUIRE A DIET MONITORING APPROACH TO ESTIMATE OVERALL DIETARY COMPOSITION AND ENERGY INTAKE. ALTHOUGH WEARABLE SENSORS HAVE BEEN USED TO ESTIMATE EATING CONTEXT (E.G., FOOD TYPE AND EATING TIME), ACCURATE MONITORING OF DIETARY INTAKE HAS REMAINED A CHALLENGING PROBLEM. IN PARTICULAR, BECAUSE MONITORING DIETARY INTAKE IS A SELF-ADMINISTERED TASK THAT INVOLVES THE END-USER TO RECORD OR REPORT THEIR NUTRITION INTAKE, CURRENT DIET MONITORING TECHNOLOGIES ARE PRONE TO MEASUREMENT ERRORS RELATED TO CHALLENGES OF HUMAN MEMORY, ESTIMATION, AND BIAS. NEW APPROACHES BASED ON MOBILE DEVICES HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO FACILITATE THE PROCESS OF DIETARY INTAKE RECORDING. THESE TECHNOLOGIES REQUIRE INDIVIDUALS TO USE MOBILE DEVICES SUCH AS SMARTPHONES TO RECORD NUTRITION INTAKE BY EITHER ENTERING TEXT OR TAKING IMAGES OF THE FOOD. SUCH APPROACHES, HOWEVER, SUFFER FROM ERRORS DUE TO LOW ADHERENCE TO TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION AND TIME SENSITIVITY TO THE DIETARY INTAKE CONTEXT. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE INTRODUCE EZNUTRIPAL, AN INTERACTIVE DIET MONITORING SYSTEM THAT OPERATES ON UNSTRUCTURED MOBILE DATA SUCH AS SPEECH AND FREE-TEXT TO FACILITATE DIETARY RECORDING, REAL-TIME PROMPTING, AND PERSONALIZED NUTRITION MONITORING. EZNUTRIPAL FEATURES A NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING UNIT THAT LEARNS INCREMENTALLY TO ADD USER-SPECIFIC NUTRITION DATA AND RULES TO THE SYSTEM. TO PREVENT MISSING DATA THAT ARE REQUIRED FOR DIETARY MONITORING (E.G., CALORIE INTAKE ESTIMATION), EZNUTRIPAL DEVISES AN INTERACTIVE OPERATING MODE THAT PROMPTS THE END-USER TO COMPLETE MISSING DATA IN REAL-TIME.

LOWER LEVELS OF CLOUT (SOCIAL STANDING) WERE INDICATED IN ALL GROUPS, AND A LOWER LEVEL OF ANALYTICAL THINKING STYLE (CONCEPTS AND COMPLEX CATEGORIES RATHER THAN NARRATIVES) WAS FOUND IN THE HYPERACUSIS SAMPLE. ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE LANGUAGE INDICATED HIGHER LEVELS OF SADNESS AND ANXIETY IN ALL GROUPS AND LOWER LEVELS OF ANGER, PARTICULARLY FOR INITIAL REPLIES. THESE DATA SUPPORT PRIOR FINDINGS INDICATING HIGHER LEVELS OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION IN THIS PATIENT POPULATION BASED ON THE ACTUAL WORDS IN BLOG POSTS AND NOT FROM SELF-REPORT QUESTIONNAIRES. QUALITATIVE RESULTS IDENTIFIED 3 MAJOR THEMES FROM BOTH THE TINNITUS AND HYPERACUSIS TEXTS: SUFFERING, NEGATIVE EMOTIONAL TONE, AND COPING STRATEGIES. CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS FROM THIS STUDY SUGGEST SUPPORT FOR THE PREDOMINANT CLINICAL VIEW THAT PATIENTS WITH TINNITUS AND HYPERACUSIS HAVE HIGHER LEVELS OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION. THE EXTENT OF THE SUFFERING DESCRIBED AND PATTERNS OF COPING STRATEGIES SUGGEST CLINICAL PRACTICE PATTERNS AND THE NEED FOR RESEARCH IN IMPLEMENTING IMPROVED PRACTICE PLANS.

THEREFORE, THIS RESEARCH SYSTEMATICALLY EXPLORES IN FOUR SEPARATE STUDIES HOW CONSISTENTLY INDIVIDUALS DETECT DISCRETE EMOTIONS IN TEXT-BASED (EMAIL) NEGOTIATIONS. STUDY 1 COMPARED THE RATINGS FROM TWO CODERS USING A HIGH QUANTITY OF THOUGHT UNITS (N = 1317) AND A NEGATIVE BARGAINING ZONE NEGOTIATION SCENARIO. IN STUDIES 2 AND 3, THREE DIFFERENT NEGOTIATION SCENARIOS WERE EXPLORED, FIRST ON A THOUGHT UNIT LEVEL AND THEN ON A MESSAGE UNIT LEVEL USING A HIERARCHICAL EMOTION CODING SCHEME. IN ALL THREE STUDIES, CODERS PERCEPTIONS WERE ALSO COMPARED WITH THE TEXT ANALYSIS PROGRAM LIWC. STUDY 4 COMPARED CODING FROM SEVEN OF THE ACTUAL NEGOTIATORS WITH THAT OF AN INDEPENDENT CODER AND A COMPUTERIZED TEXT PROGRAM. ALL FOUR STUDIES FOUND LOW EMOTION RECOGNITION CONSISTENCY ACROSS 14 DIFFERENT CODERS WITH ONLY ONE NEGOTIATION SCENARIO IN STUDY 3 SHOWING A MODERATE LEVEL OF CONSISTENCY. COMPARISONS OF COMPUTERIZED CODING WITH HUMAN CODERS DID NOT SHOW IMPROVED AGREEMENT. HIGH AMOUNTS OF CONTRARY CODING BY INDEPENDENT CODERS WERE ALSO FOUND.

HOWEVER, SUCH INVESTIGATIONS ARE CRITICAL TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL UTILITY AND LATENT SHORTCOMINGS OF SCIENCE FICTION ROBOTS FOR FUTURE HRI RESEARCH, INNOVATION, AND EDUCATION. TO ADDRESS THIS RESEARCH GAP, THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE OVERALL PRESENCE, NATURE, AND FREQUENCY OF REFERRALS OF 18 POPULAR SCIENCE FICTION ROBOTS IN THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTING MACHINERY (ACM) DIGITAL LIBRARY. THESE ROBOTS WERE EITHER PORTRAYED IN VARIOUS MOVIES AND SUBSEQUENTLY INDUCTED INTO THE ROBOT HALL OF FAME, CREATED BY CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY IN 2003, OR WERE TOP-RANKED IN A USER-CURATED INTERNET MOVIE DATABASE (IMDB) LIST. TO DO SO, WE PERFORMED FULL-TEXT SEARCH AND RETRIEVAL QUERIES OF ALL 18 ROBOTS IN THE ACM DIGITAL LIBRARY. IN TOTAL, WE IDENTIFIED 121 RELEVANT MENTIONS, ACROSS 102 INDIVIDUAL PUBLICATIONS, IN A TIME SPAN FROM 1973 TO 2017. THESE 121 MENTIONS WERE THEN QUALITATIVELY ANALYSED TO DETERMINE THE NATURE OF THE ROBOT MENTIONS. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE ROBOT ATTRIBUTES OF VOICE OR DIALOGUE WERE EMERGING AS A POPULARLY MENTIONED ELEMENT. IN ADDITION, WE FIND THAT RESEARCH PAPERS OF PHILOSOPHICAL NATURE MENTION SCI-FI ROBOTS MORE FREQUENTLY THAN PAPERS OF TECHNICAL OR THEORETICAL NATURE.

SPECIFICALLY, WE TESTED WHETHER CHANGES IN THE VOLUME OF 4-FA RELATED POSTS AND SENTIMENTS EXPRESSED IN THOSE POSTS CAN BE OBSERVED AROUND THE TIME 4-FA WAS INCREASINGLY REPORTED BY DUTCH DRUG MONITORING SOURCES (20122017). METHODS: OPENING POSTS FROM TWO POPULAR DUTCH INTERNET-BASED DRUG DISCUSSION FORUMS, WRITTEN BETWEEN JANUARY 1 ST, 2012 AND JANUARY 1 ST, 2018 WERE SCRAPED: PORTIONS OF THE FORUM POSTS ABOUT 4-FA WERE COLLECTED. TO CONTRAST 4-FA FINDINGS AGAINST OTHER CATEGORIES OF FORUM POSTS, WE ALSO COLLECTED POSTS ON TWO OTHER SUBSTANCES (ECSTASY AND COCAINE) AND POSTS NOT RELATED TO A SPECIFIC SUBSTANCE. SENTIMENTS EXPRESSED IN THESE POSTS WERE INFERRED USING TEXT RECOGNITION SOFTWARE, AND ANALYSED FOR TRENDS USING LINEAR MIXED MODELLING. RESULTS: THE NUMBER OF 4-FA POSTS INCREASED BETWEEN 2012 AND 2015: 76 POSTS IN 2012, 138 IN 2013, 322 IN 2014, 323 IN 2015, AND DECREASED THEREAFTER: 264 IN 2016 AND 135 IN 2017; X(5) = 271.8, P < .001. OVER TIME, A DECREASE IN POSITIVE SENTIMENT TOWARDS 4-FA CAN BE OBSERVED STARTING IN 2015, COMPARED TO THE PERIOD BEFORE 2015, COINCIDING WITH MORE NEWS SEARCHES AND REPORTS ON ADVERSE EVENTS RELATED TO 4-FA USE. LINEAR MIXED MODELLING ANALYSIS CONFIRMED A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER SENTIMENT SCORE IN 2015 COMPARED TO 2017 FOR 4-FA, B = 0.062; SE = 0.023; T(1252) = 2.70; P = 0.007, BUT NOT FOR POSTS ON OTHER SUBSTANCES.

THE RESEARCH DOMAIN CRITERIA (RDOC), A PROPOSED DIMENSIONAL MODEL OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY, MAY OFFER NEW INSIGHTS INTO PSYCHIATRIC ILLNESS. FOR PSYCHIATRIC CLINICIANS, HOWEVER, BECAUSE TOOLS FOR CAPTURING THESE DOMAINS IN CLINICAL PRACTICE HAVE NOT YET BEEN ESTABLISHED, THE RELEVANCE AND MEANS OF TRANSITION FROM THE CATEGORICAL SYSTEM OF DSM-5 TO THE DIMENSIONAL MODELS OF RDOC REMAINS UNCLEAR. THE AUTHORS EXPLORED A METHOD OF EXTRACTING THESE DIMENSIONS FROM EXISTING ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD (EHR) NOTES. METHOD: THE AUTHORS USED INFORMATION RETRIEVAL AND NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING METHODS TO EXTRACT ESTIMATES OF THE RDOC DIMENSIONS IN THE EHRS OF A LARGE HEALTH SYSTEM. THEY PARSED AND SCORED EHR DOCUMENTATION FOR 2,484 ADMISSIONS COVERING 2,010 PATIENTS ADMITTED TO A PSYCHIATRIC INPATIENT UNIT BETWEEN 2011 AND 2013. THESE DOMAIN SCORES WERE COMPARED WITH DSM-IV-BASED ICD-9 CODES TO ASSESS FACE VALIDITY. AS A MEASURE OF PREDICTIVE VALIDITY, THESE SCORES WERE EXAMINED FOR ASSOCIATION WITH TWO OUTCOMES: LENGTH OF HOSPITAL STAY AND TIME TO ALL-CAUSE HOSPITAL READMISSION. TOGETHER, THESE ANALYSES WERE INTENDED TO ADDRESS THE EXTENT TO WHICH RDOC SYMPTOM DOMAINS MIGHT CAPTURE CLINICAL FEATURES ALREADY AVAILABLE IN NARRATIVE NOTES BUT NOT REFLECTED IN DSM DIAGNOSES. RESULTS: IN MIXED-EFFECTS MODELS, LOADINGS FOR THE RDOC COGNITIVE AND AROUSAL DOMAINS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH LENGTH OF HOSPITAL STAY, WHILE THE NEGATIVE VALENCE AND SOCIAL DOMAINS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH HAZARD OF ALL-CAUSE HOSPITAL READMISSION. CONCLUSIONS: THESE FINDINGS SHOW THAT A COMPUTATIONALLY DERIVED TOOL BASED ON RDOC WORKGROUP REPORTS IDENTIFIES SYMPTOM DISTRIBUTIONS IN CLINICIAN NOTES BEYOND THOSE CAPTURED BY ICD-9 CODES, AND THESE DOMAINS HAVE SIGNIFICANT PREDICTIVE VALIDITY. MORE GENERALLY, THEY POINT TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT CLINICIANS ALREADY DOCUMENT RDOC-RELEVANT SYMPTOMS, ALBEIT NOT IN A QUANTIFIED FORM.",0,1,1

NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES HAVE RECENTLY BEEN UTILIZED FOR CODING MI SESSIONS USING MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES, RATHER THAN HUMAN CODERS, AND PRELIMINARY RESULTS HAVE SUGGESTED THESE METHODS HOLD PROMISE. THE CURRENT STUDY EXTENDS THIS PREVIOUS WORK BY INTRODUCING TWO NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING MODELS FOR AUTOMATICALLY CODING MI SESSIONS VIA COMPUTER. THE TWO MODELS DIFFER IN THE WAY THEY SEMANTICALLY REPRESENT SESSION CONTENT, UTILIZING EITHER 1) SIMPLE DISCRETE SENTENCE FEATURES (DSF MODEL) AND 2) MORE COMPLEX RECURSIVE NEURAL NETWORKS (RNN MODEL). UTTERANCE- AND SESSION-LEVEL PREDICTIONS FROM THESE MODELS WERE COMPARED TO RATINGS PROVIDED BY HUMAN CODERS USING A LARGE SAMPLE OF MI SESSIONS (N=341 SESSIONS; 78,977 CLINICIAN AND CLIENT TALK TURNS) FROM 6 MI STUDIES. RESULTS SHOW THAT THE DSF MODEL GENERALLY HAD SLIGHTLY BETTER PERFORMANCE COMPARED TO THE RNN MODEL. THE DSF MODEL HAD ""GOOD"" OR HIGHER UTTERANCE-LEVEL AGREEMENT WITH HUMAN CODERS (COHEN'S KAPPA>0.60) FOR OPEN AND CLOSED QUESTIONS, AFFIRM, GIVING INFORMATION, AND FOLLOW/NEUTRAL (ALL THERAPIST CODES); CONSIDERABLY HIGHER AGREEMENT WAS OBTAINED FOR SESSION-LEVEL INDICES, AND MANY ESTIMATES WERE COMPETITIVE WITH HUMAN-TO-HUMAN AGREEMENT.

RESIDENTS CAN ASK FOR HELP AT ANY POINT IN THE CASE, AND WILL RECEIVE CONTEXT-SPECIFIC FEEDBACK. RESEARCH QUESTIONS: WE EVALUATED (1) THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR NATURAL LANGUAGE SYSTEM, (2) THE EFFECT OF THE SYSTEM ON LEARNING (3) THE EFFECT OF FEEDBACK TIMING ON LEARNING GAINS AND (4) THE EFFECT OF REPORTTUTOR ON PERFORMANCE TO SELF-ASSESSMENT CORRELATIONS. METHODS: THE STUDY USES A CROSSOVER 2 2 FACTORIAL DESIGN. WE RECRUITED 20 SUBJECTS FROM 4 ACADEMIC PROGRAMS. SUBJECTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO ONE OF THE FOUR CONDITIONSTWO CONDITIONS FOR THE IMMEDIATE INTERFACE, AND TWO FOR THE DELAYED INTERFACE.

WHEREAS THIS WAS SHOWN IN THE CONSCIOUS PROCESS OF AWAKE PATIENTS BY DIFFERENT MEASURES AND AT DIFFERENT TIME SCALES, DREAMS CAME VERY SELDOM INTO THE FOCUS OF INVESTIGATION. THE PRESENT WORK TESTS THE HYPOTHESIS THAT, BY DREAMING, THE PATIENT GETS PROGRESSIVELY MORE ACCESS TO AFFECTIVE-LADEN (I.E., EMOTIONALLY CHARGED) UNCONSCIOUS DIMENSIONS. FURTHERMORE, THE STUDY INVESTIGATES IF, OVER THE COURSE OF PSYCHOTHERAPY, A DISCONTINUOUS PHASE TRANSITION OCCURS IN THE PATIENT'S CAPACITY TO GET IN CONTACT WITH THOSE UNCONSCIOUS DIMENSIONS. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: A SERIES OF 95 DREAM NARRATIVES REPORTED DURING A PSYCHOANALYTIC PSYCHOTHERAPY OF A FEMALE PATIENT (PUBLISHED AS THE ""DREAMS OF AMALIE X"") WAS USED FOR ANALYSIS. AN AUTOMATED TEXT ANALYSIS PROCEDURE BASED ON MULTIPLE CORRESPONDENCE ANALYSIS WAS APPLIED TO THE TEXTUAL CORPUS OF THE DREAMS, HIGHLIGHTING A 10-FACTOR STRUCTURE. THE FACTORS, INTERPRETED AS AFFECTIVE-LADEN UNCONSCIOUS MEANING DIMENSIONS, WERE ADOPTED TO DEFINE A 10-DIMENSIONAL PHASE SPACE, IN WHICH THE ABILITY OF A DREAM TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH ONE OR MORE LOCAL FACTORS REPRESENTING COMPLEX AFFECTIVE-LADEN MEANINGS IS MEASURED BY THE EUCLIDEAN DISTANCE (ED) FROM THE ORIGIN OF THIS HYPERSPACE. THE OBTAINED ED TIME SERIES HAS BEEN FITTED BY AN AUTOREGRESSIVE INTEGRATED MOVING AVERAGE (ARIMA) MODEL AND BY NON LINEAR METHODS LIKE DYNAMIC COMPLEXITY, RECURRENCE PLOT, AND TIME FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION. CHANGE POINT ANALYSIS WAS APPLIED TO THESE NON LINEAR METHODS. RESULTS: THE RESULTS SHOW AN INCREASED FREQUENCY AND INTENSITY OF DREAMS TO GET ACCESS TO AFFECTIVE-LADEN MEANINGS. NON LINEAR METHODS IDENTIFIED A PHASE TRANSITION-LIKE JUMP OF THE ED DYNAMICS ONTO A HIGHER COMPLEXITY LEVEL OF THE DREAMING PROCESS, SUGGESTING A NON LINEAR PROCESS IN THE PATIENT'S CAPACITY TO GET IN CONTACT WITH UNCONSCIOUS DIMENSIONS. CONCLUSION: THE STUDY CORROBORATES THE HYPOTHESIS THAT, BY DREAMING, THE PATIENT GETS PROGRESSIVELY MORE ACCESS TO AFFECTIVE-LADEN MEANING INTENDED AS UNCONSCIOUS DIMENSIONS. THE TRAJECTORY OF THIS PROCESS HAS BEEN REPRODUCED BY AN ARIMA MODEL, AND BEYOND THIS, NON LINEAR METHODS OF TIME SERIES ANALYSIS ALLOWED THE IDENTIFICATION OF A PHASE TRANSITION IN THE UNCONSCIOUS PROCESS OF THE PSYCHOANALYTIC THERAPY UNDER INVESTIGATION.",1,1,0

RECENTLY INFORMATION DERIVED FROM NEWS ARTICLES HAS BECOME A PART OF FINANCIAL PREDICTIVE SYSTEMS. THE USAGE OF NEWS ARTICLES AND THEIR FORECASTING POTENTIAL HAVE BEEN EXTENSIVELY RESEARCHED. HOWEVER, SO FAR NO ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO UTILISE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF NEWS ARTICLES SIMULTANEOUSLY. THIS PAPER STUDIES HOW THE CONCURRENT, AND APPROPRIATELY WEIGHTED, USAGE OF NEWS ARTICLES, HAVING DIFFERENT DEGREES OF RELEVANCE TO THE TARGET STOCK, CAN IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF FINANCIAL FORECASTING AND SUPPORT THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS OF INVESTORS AND TRADERS. STOCK PRICE MOVEMENTS ARE PREDICTED USING THE MULTIPLE KERNEL LEARNING TECHNIQUE WHICH INTEGRATES INFORMATION EXTRACTED FROM MULTIPLE NEWS CATEGORIES WHILE SEPARATE KERNELS ARE UTILISED TO ANALYSE EACH CATEGORY. NEWS ARTICLES ARE PARTITIONED ACCORDING TO THEIR RELEVANCE TO THE TARGET STOCK, ITS SUB-INDUSTRY, INDUSTRY, GROUP INDUSTRY AND SECTOR. THE EXPERIMENTS ARE RUN ON STOCKS FROM THE HEALTH CARE SECTOR AND SHOW THAT INCREASING THE NUMBER OF RELEVANT NEWS CATEGORIES USED AS DATA SOURCES FOR FINANCIAL FORECASTING IMPROVES THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PREDICTIVE SYSTEM IN COMPARISON WITH APPROACHES BASED ON A LOWER NUMBER OF CATEGORIES.

THIS CAN ENABLE MARKETERS TO ANALYZE THE TEXTUAL CONTENT OF ONLINE REVIEWS WITH THE AIM TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF EMOTIONS AND HOW THEY CAN AFFECT OTHER CUSTOMERS. IN THIS PAPER, WE PRESENT AN APPROACH TO EXTRACTING EMOTION CONTENT FROM ONLINE REVIEWS IN ORDER TO MEASURE THE IMPORTANCE OF VARIOUS EMOTION DIMENSIONS WITHIN DIFFERENT PRODUCT CATEGORIES. THE APPROACH USES AN EMOTION LEXICON TO EXTRACT EMOTION TERMS, WHILE IT ALSO BUILDS A CLASSIFICATION MODEL TO MEASURE THE IMPORTANCE OF EMOTION DIMENSIONS BASED ON THE QUALITY OF REVIEWS. REVIEW QUALITY IS MEASURED BASED ON THE USEFULNESS OF ONLINE CUSTOMER REVIEWS, WHICH ARE PERCEIVED AND EVALUATED BY OTHER CUSTOMERS THROUGH THEIR HELPFULNESS RATINGS. THIS APPROACH ALLOWS THE IDENTIFICATION OF EMOTION DIMENSIONS THAT CHARACTERIZE QUALITATIVE REVIEWS. THE EMPIRICAL EVALUATION IN OUR STUDY SUGGESTS THAT TRUST, JOY, AND ANTICIPATION ARE THE MOST DECISIVE EMOTION DIMENSIONS, ALTHOUGH SUBSTANTIAL VARIANCE ACROSS PRODUCT CATEGORIES CAN ALSO BE DETECTED. ADDITIONALLY, WE COMPARED TWO CONTRASTING EMOTION DICTIONARIES. ONE LEXICON WAS CROWD-FUNDED AND CONTAINED A LARGE VOCABULARY, WHEREAS THE OTHER WAS MORE FOCUSED AND SMALLER, SINCE IT WAS CREATED WORD-WISE BY AN EXPERT. OUR EMPIRICAL FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THE CROWD-FUNDED SOLUTION OUTPERFORMS ITS SMALLER COUNTERPART IN TERMS OF CLASSIFICATION PRECISION. THE MAIN IMPLICATION OF THIS STUDY IS THAT IT ADDS AN EMOTIONAL PERSPECTIVE TO THE BROAD SET OF EXISTING TOOLS THAT MARKETERS EMPLOY TO ANALYZING ONLINE REVIEWS.

THE MOST POPULAR WAY TO REPRESENT COMMON-SENSE KNOWLEDGE IS IN THE FORM OF A SEMANTIC GRAPH. SUCH TYPE OF KNOWLEDGE, HOWEVER, IS KNOWN TO BE RATHER EXTENSIVE: THE MORE CONCEPTS ADDED IN THE GRAPH, THE HARDER AND SLOWER IT BECOMES TO APPLY STANDARD GRAPH MINING TECHNIQUES. METHODS: IN THIS WORK, WE PROPOSE A NEW FAST SUBGRAPH MATCHING APPROACH TO OVERCOME THESE ISSUES. SUBGRAPH MATCHING IS THE TASK OF FINDING ALL MATCHES OF A QUERY GRAPH IN A LARGE DATA GRAPH, WHICH IS KNOWN TO BE A NON-DETERMINISTIC POLYNOMIAL TIME-COMPLETE PROBLEM. MANY ALGORITHMS HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY PROPOSED TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM USING CENTRAL PROCESSING UNITS. HERE, WE PRESENT A NEW GRAPHICS PROCESSING UNIT-FRIENDLY METHOD FOR COMMON-SENSE SUBGRAPH MATCHING, TERMED GPSENSE, WHICH IS DESIGNED FOR SCALABLE MASSIVELY PARALLEL ARCHITECTURES, TO ENABLE NEXT-GENERATION BIG DATA SENTIMENT ANALYSIS AND NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING APPLICATIONS.

USING SENTIMENT ANALYSIS AND A DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCE APPROACH TO ANALYZE MORE THAN 250,000 TWEETS, THE AUTHOR FINDS THAT SB 1070 HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE AVERAGE SENTIMENT OF TWEETS REGARDING IMMIGRANTS, MEXICANS, AND HISPANICS, BUT NOT ON THOSE ABOUT ASIANS OR BLACKS. HOWEVER, THESE CHANGES IN PUBLIC DISCOURSE WERE NOT CAUSED BY SHIFTING ATTITUDES TOWARD IMMIGRANTS BUT BY THE MOBILIZATION OF ANTI-IMMIGRANT USERS AND BY MOTIVATING NEW USERS TO BEGIN TWEETING.

SOCIAL MEDIA DATA PRESENT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MENTAL HEALTH SURVEILLANCE AFTER DISASTERS TO HELP IDENTIFY AREAS OF MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. WE AIMED TO 1) IDENTIFY SPECIFIC BASIC EMOTIONS FROM TWITTER FOR THE GREATER NEW YORK CITY AREA DURING HURRICANE SANDY, WHICH MADE LANDFALL ON OCTOBER 29, 2012, AND TO 2) DETECT AND MAP SPATIAL TEMPORAL CLUSTERS REPRESENTING EXCESS RISK OF THESE EMOTIONS. METHODS: WE APPLIED AN ADVANCED SENTIMENT ANALYSIS ON 344,957 TWITTER TWEETS IN THE STUDY AREA OVER ELEVEN DAYS, FROM OCTOBER 22 TO NOVEMBER 1, 2012, TO EXTRACT BASIC EMOTIONS, A SPACE-TIME SCAN STATISTIC (SATSCAN) AND A GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM (QGIS) TO DETECT AND MAP EXCESS RISK OF THESE EMOTIONS. RESULTS: SADNESS AND DISGUST WERE AMONG THE MOST PROMINENT EMOTIONS IDENTIFIED. FURTHERMORE, WE NOTED 24 SPATIAL CLUSTERS OF EXCESS RISK OF BASIC EMOTIONS OVER TIME: FOUR FOR ANGER, ONE FOR CONFUSION, THREE FOR DISGUST, FIVE FOR FEAR, FIVE FOR SADNESS, AND SIX FOR SURPRISE. OF THESE, ANGER, CONFUSION, DISGUST AND FEAR CLUSTERS APPEARED PRE DISASTER, A CLUSTER OF SURPRISE WAS FOUND PERI DISASTER, AND A CLUSTER OF SADNESS EMERGED POST DISASTER. CONCLUSIONS: WE PROPOSED A NOVEL SYNDROMIC SURVEILLANCE APPROACH FOR MENTAL HEALTH BASED ON SOCIAL MEDIA DATA THAT MAY SUPPORT CONVENTIONAL APPROACHES BY PROVIDING USEFUL ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IN THE CONTEXT OF DISASTER. WE SHOWED THAT EXCESS RISK OF MULTIPLE BASIC EMOTIONS COULD BE MAPPED IN SPACE AND TIME AS A STEP TOWARDS ANTICIPATING ACUTE STRESS IN THE POPULATION AND IDENTIFYING COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH NEED RAPIDLY AND EFFICIENTLY IN THE AFTERMATH OF DISASTER.

THESE LIFESTYLE EXPOSURES ARE MAINLY MENTIONED IN FREE-TEXT ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHRS). HOWEVER, AUTOMATIC EXTRACTION AND ASSESSMENT OF THESE EXPOSURES USING EHRS REMAINS UNDERSTUDIED. METHODS: A NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) APPROACH WAS ADOPTED TO EXTRACT LIFESTYLE EXPOSURES AND INTERVENTION STRATEGIES FROM THE CLINICAL NOTES OF 260 PATIENTS WITH CLINICAL DIAGNOSES OF AD DEMENTIA AND 260 AGE-MATCHED COGNITIVELY UNIMPAIRED PERSONS. STATISTICS OF LIFESTYLE EXPOSURES WERE COMPARED BETWEEN THESE TWO GROUPS. THE MAPPING RESULTS OF THE NLP EXTRACTION WERE EVALUATED BY COMPARING THE RESULTS WITH DATA CAPTURED INDEPENDENTLY BY CLINICIANS. RESULTS: THIRTY OUT OF FIFTY-FIVE POTENTIALLY RELEVANT LIFESTYLE EXPOSURES WERE MENTIONED IN OUR CLINICAL NOTE DATASET. TWENTY-TWO DIETARY FACTORS AND THREE SUBSTANCE ABUSES THAT WERE POTENTIALLY RELEVANT WERE NOT FOUND IN CLINICAL NOTES. PATIENTS WITH AD DEMENTIA WERE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPOSED TO MORE OF THE POTENTIAL RISK FACTORS COMPARED TO THE COGNITIVELY UNIMPAIRED SUBJECTS (2 = 120.31, P-VALUE < 0.001). THE AVERAGE ACCURACY OF THE AUTOMATED EXTRACTION WAS 74.0% IN COMPARISON WITH THE MANUAL REVIEW OF RANDOMLY SELECTED 50 SAMPLE DOCUMENTS.

WE ANALYZED THE READABILITY AND LINGUISTIC PSYCHOLOGICAL AND EMOTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF DIFFERENT TEXTUAL SUMMARY FORMATS OF COCHRANE SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS. METHODS: WE PERFORMED A MULTITRAIT-MULTIMETHOD CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY OF PRESS RELEASES AVAILABLE AT COCHRANE WEB SITE (N = 162) AND CORRESPONDING SCIENTIFIC ABSTRACTS (N = 158), COCHRANE CLINICAL ANSWERS (N = 35) AND PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARIES IN ENGLISH (N = 156), FRENCH (N = 101), GERMAN (N = 41) AND CROATIAN (N = 156). WE USED SMOG INDEX TO ASSESS TEXT READABILITY OF ALL TEXT FORMATS, AND NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TOOLS (IBM WATSON TONE ANALYZER, STANFORD NLP SENTIMENT ANALYSIS AND LINGUISTIC INQUIRY AND WORD COUNT) TO EXAMINE THE AFFECTIVE STATES AND SUBJECTIVE INFORMATION IN TEXTS OF SCIENTIFIC ABSTRACTS, PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARIES AND PRESS RELEASES. RESULTS: ALL TEXT FORMATS HAD LOW READABILITY, WITH SMOG INDEX RANGING FROM A MEDIAN OF 15.6 (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) 15.3-15.9) FOR SCIENTIFIC ABSTRACTS TO 14.7 (95% CI 14.4-15.0) FOR PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARIES. IN ALL TEXT FORMATS, ""SADNESS"" WAS THE MOST DOMINANTLY PERCEIVED EMOTIONAL TONE AND THE STYLE OF WRITING WAS PERCEIVED AS ""ANALYTICAL"" AND ""TENTATIVE"". AT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL LEVEL, ALL TEXT FORMATS EXHIBITED THE PREDOMINANT ""OPENNESS"" TONE, AND PRESS RELEASES SCORED HIGHER ON THE SCALES OF ""CONSCIENTIOUSNESS"", ""AGREEABLENESS"" AND ""EMOTIONAL RANGE"". PRESS RELEASES HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER SCORES THAN SCIENTIFIC ABSTRACTS AND PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARIES ON THE DIMENSIONS OF ""CLOUT"", AND ""EMOTIONAL TONE"". CONCLUSIONS: ALTHOUGH THE READABILITY OF PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARIES WAS HIGHER THAN THAT OF TEXT FORMATS TARGETING MORE EXPERT AUDIENCES, THE REQUIRED LITERACY WAS MUCH HIGHER THAN THE RECOMMENDED US 6TH GRADE LEVEL. THE LANGUAGE OF PRESS RELEASES WAS GENERALLY MORE ENGAGING THAN THAT OF SCIENTIFIC ABSTRACTS AND PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARIES, WHICH ARE WRITTEN BY THE AUTHORS OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS.

METHODS: DUE TO THE SHORT NATURE OF THE TEXTS, WHICH IS RELATED TO THE DIFFICULTY OF EXPRESSING ONESELF ABOUT ONE'S BODY WHEN SUFFERING FROM ANOREXIA, THE BAG OF WORDS APPROACH WAS USED FOR DOCUMENTS' INFORMATION REPRESENTATION. THE DOCUMENT IS REPRESENTED AS A VECTOR, WHERE ITS VARIOUS ELEMENTS INDICATE THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL WORDS. THEN, A RULE-BASED MODEL WAS CREATED, WHERE AS A COLLECTION OF RULES, DICTIONARY FILES WERE USED CORRESPONDING TO THREE GROUPS OF POSITIVE, NEGATIVE AND NEUTRAL SOUNDS FOR EACH SUBCATEGORY.

THE EFFECTS OF HIV INFECTION AND HIV-RELATED VARIABLES ON SMOKING AND SMOKING CESSATION ARE INCOMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD. WE INVESTIGATED THE CORRELATES OF SMOKING AND QUITTING IN AN HIV-INFECTED COHORT USING A VALIDATED NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSOR TO DETERMINE SMOKING STATUS. METHOD: WE DEVELOPED AND VALIDATED AN ALGORITHM USING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) TO ASCERTAIN SMOKING STATUS FROM ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD DATA. THE ALGORITHM WAS APPLIED TO RECORDS FOR A COHORT OF 3487 HIV-INFECTED FROM A LARGE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN BOSTON, USA, AND 9446 UNINFECTED CONTROL PATIENTS MATCHED 3:1 ON AGE, GENDER, RACE AND CLINICAL ENCOUNTERS. NLP WAS USED TO IDENTIFY AND CLASSIFY SMOKING-RELATED PORTIONS OF FREE-TEXT NOTES. THESE CLASSIFICATIONS WERE COMBINED INTO PATIENT-YEAR SMOKING STATUS AND USED TO CLASSIFY PATIENTS AS EVER VERSUS NEVER SMOKERS AND CURRENT SMOKERS VERSUS NON-SMOKERS. GENERALIZED LINEAR MODELS WERE USED TO ASSESS ASSOCIATIONS OF HIV WITH 3 OUTCOMES, EVER SMOKING, CURRENT SMOKING, AND CURRENT SMOKING IN ANALYSES LIMITED TO EVER SMOKERS (PERSISTENT SMOKING), WHILE ADJUSTING FOR DEMOGRAPHICS, CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS, AND PSYCHIATRIC ILLNESS. ANALYSES WERE REPEATED WITHIN THE HIV COHORT, WITH THE ADDITION OF CD4 CELL COUNT AND HIV VIRAL LOAD TO ASSESS ASSOCIATIONS OF THESE HIV-RELATED FACTORS WITH THE SMOKING OUTCOMES. RESULTS: USING THE NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING ALGORITHM TO ASSIGN ANNUAL SMOKING STATUS YIELDED SENSITIVITY OF 92.4, SPECIFICITY OF 86.2, AND AUC OF 0.89 (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI] 0.88-0.91). EVER AND CURRENT SMOKING WERE MORE COMMON IN HIV-INFECTED PATIENTS THAN CONTROLS (54% VS. 44% AND 42% VS. 30%, RESPECTIVELY, BOTH P<0.001). IN MULTIVARIATE MODELS HIV WAS INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH EVER SMOKING (ADJUSTED RATE RATIO [ARR] 1.18, 95% CI 1.13-1.24, P <0.001), CURRENT SMOKING (ARR 1.33, 95% CI 1.25-1.40, P<0.001), AND PERSISTENT SMOKING (ARR 1.11, 95% CI 1.07-1.15, P<0.001).

METHODS: THE FIRST STEP WAS TO STANDARDIZE TEXTUAL DATA PROGRAMMATICALLY USING NLP LIBRARIES. THIS INCLUDED CORRECTING SPELLING MISTAKES, CONVERTING TEXT TO LOWERCASE, AND REMOVING WORDS THAT MOST LIKELY DID NOT CARRY USEFUL INFORMATION. NEXT, WE CONVERTED NUMERIC DATA PERTAINING TO EACH CATEGORY BASED ON SENTIMENT AND CARE ASPECT INTO CHARTS. WE SELECTED CARE ASPECT CATEGORIES WHERE THERE WERE MORE NEGATIVE COMMENTS FOR MORE IN-DEPTH STUDY. USING NLP, WE MADE TABLES OF MOST FREQUENTLY APPEARING WORDS, ADJECTIVES, AND BIGRAMS. COMMENTS WITH FREQUENT WORDS/COMBINATIONS UNDERWENT FURTHER STUDY MANUALLY TO UNDERSTAND FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO NEGATIVE PATIENT FEEDBACK. WE THEN USED THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE COMMENTS AS THE TRAINING DATASET FOR A NEURAL NETWORK TO PERFORM SENTIMENT ANALYSIS ON SENTENCES OBTAINED BY SPLITTING MIXED REVIEWS. RESULTS: WE FOUND THAT MOST OF THE COMMENTS WERE ABOUT DOCTORS AND NURSES, CONFIRMING THE IMPORTANT ROLE PATIENTS ASCRIBED TO THESE TWO IN PATIENT CARE. ""ROOM,"" ""DISCHARGE"" AND ""TESTS AND TREATMENTS"" WERE THE THREE CATEGORIES THAT HAD MORE NEGATIVE THAN POSITIVE COMMENTS. WE THEN TABULATED COMMONLY APPEARING WORDS, ADJECTIVES, AND TWO-WORD COMBINATIONS. WE FOUND THAT CLIMATE CONTROL, HOUSEKEEPING AND NOISE LEVELS IN THE ROOM, TIME DELAYS IN DISCHARGE PAPERWORK, CONFLICTING INFORMATION ABOUT DISCHARGE PLAN, FREQUENT BLOOD DRAWS, AND NEEDLE STICKS WERE MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS TO NEGATIVE PATIENT FEEDBACK.

HOW EXACTLY THE BRAIN EXTRACTS THE SENTIMENT OF SINGLE WORDS DURING NATURALISTIC READING IS LARGELY UNKNOWN. THIS IS DUE TO THE CHALLENGES OF NATURALISTIC IMAGING, WHICH HAS PREVIOUSLY LED RESEARCHERS TO EMPLOY HIGHLY CONTROLLED, TIMED WORD-BY-WORD PRESENTATIONS OF CUSTOM READING MATERIALS THAT LACK ECOLOGICAL VALIDITY.

AS GUIDED ICBT IS CONSIDERED MORE EFFECTIVE THAN UNGUIDED ICBT, SUCH AUTOMATED FEEDBACK MAY HELP CLOSE THE GAP BETWEEN THE TWO.

THIS PAPER PRESENTS AN EMPIRICAL STUDY IN WHICH AUTOMATED SENTIMENT ANALYSIS BY AN ALGORITHM FOR THE DUTCH LANGUAGE IS VALIDATED AGAINST HUMAN JUDGMENT. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 493 ICBT USER TEXTS WERE EVALUATED ON OVERALL SENTIMENT AND THE PRESENCE OF FIVE SPECIFIC EMOTIONS BY AN ALGORITHM, AND BY 52 PSYCHOLOGY STUDENTS WHO EVALUATED 75 RANDOMLY SELECTED TEXTS EACH, PROVIDING ABOUT EIGHT HUMAN EVALUATIONS PER TEXT. INTER-RATER AGREEMENT (IRR) BETWEEN ALGORITHM AND HUMANS, AND HUMANS AMONG EACH OTHER, WAS ANALYZED BY CALCULATING THE INTRA-CLASS CORRELATION UNDER A NUMERICAL INTERPRETATION OF THE DATA, AND COHEN'S KAPPA, AND KRIPPENDORFF'S ALPHA UNDER A CATEGORICAL INTERPRETATION. RESULTS: ALL ANALYSES INDICATED MODERATE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE ALGORITHM AND AVERAGE HUMAN JUDGMENT WITH RESPECT TO EVALUATING OVERALL SENTIMENT, AND LOW AGREEMENT FOR THE SPECIFIC EMOTIONS. SOMEWHAT SURPRISINGLY, THE SAME WAS THE CASE FOR THE IRR AMONG HUMAN JUDGES, WHICH MEANS THAT THE ALGORITHM PERFORMED ABOUT AS WELL AS A RANDOMLY SELECTED HUMAN JUDGE. THUS, CONSIDERING AVERAGE HUMAN JUDGMENT AS A BENCHMARK FOR THE APPLICABILITY OF AUTOMATED SENTIMENT ANALYSIS, THE TECHNIQUE CAN BE CONSIDERED FOR PRACTICAL APPLICATION. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: THE LOW HUMAN-HUMAN AGREEMENT ON THE PRESENCE OF EMOTIONS MAY BE DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE TEXTS, IT MAY SIMPLY BE DIFFICULT FOR HUMANS TO AGREE ON THE PRESENCE OF THE SELECTED EMOTIONS, OR PERHAPS TRAINED THERAPISTS WOULD HAVE REACHED MORE CONSENSUS. FUTURE RESEARCH MAY FOCUS ON VALIDATING THE ALGORITHM AGAINST A MORE SOLID BENCHMARK, ON APPLYING THE ALGORITHM IN AN APPLICATION IN WHICH EMPATHIC FEEDBACK IS PROVIDED, FOR EXAMPLE, BY AN EMBODIED CONVERSATIONAL AGENT, OR ON IMPROVING THE ALGORITHM FOR THE ICBT DOMAIN WITH A BOTTOM-UP MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH.",1,1,1

"196","JR MCTH, 2019, ","OBJECTIVE: TO DETERMINE THE DEGREE TO WHICH DIMENSIONAL PSYCHOPATHOLOGY PREDICTS LENGTH OF STAY IN AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) AND NEED FOR HOSPITAL ADMISSION AMONG CHILDREN WITH PSYCHIATRIC COMPLAINTS. METHOD: ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS OF CHILDREN AGE 4-17 YEARS WHO PRESENTED TO THE ED OF A LARGE ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER WERE ANALYZED USING A NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TOOL TO ESTIMATE RESEARCH DOMAIN CRITERIA (RDOC) SYMPTOM SCORES. THESE SCORES' ASSOCIATION WITH LENGTH OF STAY AND PROBABILITY OF ADMISSION VERSUS DISCHARGE TO HOME WERE EVALUATED. RESULTS: WE IDENTIFIED 3061 CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WHO PRESENTED TO THE ED AND WERE EVALUATED BY THE PSYCHIATRY SERVICE BETWEEN NOVEMBER 2008 AND MARCH 2015. MEDIAN LENGTH OF STAY WAS 7.8 H (INTERQUARTILE RANGE 5.2-14.3 H) AND 1696 (55.4%) WERE ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL. HIGHER ESTIMATED RDOC AROUSAL, COGNITIVE, POSITIVE, AND SOCIAL DOMAIN SCORES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED LENGTH OF STAY IN MULTIPLE REGRESSION MODELS, ADJUSTED FOR AGE, SEX, RACE, PRIVATE INSURANCE, VOLUNTARY ADMISSION, AND DIAGNOSTIC CATEGORIES. IN SIMILARLY ADJUSTED MODELS, ODDS OF HOSPITAL ADMISSION WERE INCREASED BY HIGHER RDOC AROUSAL AND COGNITIVE DOMAIN SCORES AND DECREASED BY HIGHER NEGATIVE DOMAIN SCORES.

THE RED+ALIGN CLASSIFIER COMBINES RED WITH AN ALIGNMENT ALGORITHM, AND RED+SVM COMBINES RED WITH A SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM) CLASSIFIER. TWO CLINICAL DATASETS WERE USED FOR TESTING AND EVALUATION: THE SMOKE DATASET, CONTAINING 1091 TEXT SNIPPETS DESCRIBING SMOKING STATUS; AND THE PAIN DATASET, CONTAINING 702 SNIPPETS DESCRIBING PAIN STATUS. WE PERFORMED 10-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION TO CALCULATE ACCURACY, PRECISION, RECALL, AND F-MEASURE METRICS. IN THE EVALUATION, AN SVM CLASSIFIER WAS TRAINED AS THE CONTROL. RESULTS: THE TWO RED CLASSIFIERS ACHIEVED 80.9-83.0% IN OVERALL ACCURACY ON THE TWO DATASETS, WHICH IS 1.3-3% HIGHER THAN SVM'S ACCURACY (P<0.001).

WE SOUGHT TO CHARACTERISE THE (ONLINE) LIVES OF PEOPLE WHO MENTION THE WORDS 'LONELY' OR 'ALONE' IN THEIR TWITTER TIMELINE AND CORRELATE THEIR POSTS WITH PREDICTORS OF MENTAL HEALTH. SETTING AND DESIGN: FROM APPROXIMATELY 400 MILLION TWEETS COLLECTED FROM TWITTER IN PENNSYLVANIA, USA, BETWEEN 2012 AND 2016, WE IDENTIFIED USERS WHOSE TWITTER POSTS CONTAINED THE WORDS 'LONELY' OR 'ALONE' AND COMPARED THEM TO A CONTROL GROUP MATCHED BY AGE, GENDER AND PERIOD OF POSTING. USING NATURAL-LANGUAGE PROCESSING, WE CHARACTERISED THE TOPICS AND DIURNAL PATTERNS OF USERS' POSTS, THEIR ASSOCIATION WITH LINGUISTIC MARKERS OF MENTAL HEALTH AND IF LANGUAGE CAN PREDICT MANIFESTATIONS OF LONELINESS. THE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS, DATA SYNTHESIS AND MODEL CREATION WERE CONDUCTED IN 2018-2019. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: WE EVALUATED COUNTS OF LANGUAGE FEATURES IN THE USERS WITH POSTS INCLUDING THE WORDS LONELY OR ALONE COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP. THESE LANGUAGE FEATURES WERE MEASURED BY (A) OPEN-VOCABULARY TOPICS, (B) LINGUISTIC INQUIRY WORD COUNT (LIWC) LEXICON, (C) LINGUISTIC MARKERS OF ANGER, DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY, AND (D) TEMPORAL PATTERNS AND NUMBER OF DRUG WORDS. USING MACHINE LEARNING, WE ALSO EVALUATED IF EXPRESSIONS OF LONELINESS CAN BE PREDICTED IN USERS' TIMELINES, MEASURED BY AREA UNDER CURVE (AUC). RESULTS: TWITTER TIMELINES OF USERS (N=6202) WITH POSTS INCLUDING THE WORDS LONELY OR ALONE WERE FOUND TO INCLUDE THEMES ABOUT DIFFICULT INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, PSYCHOSOMATIC SYMPTOMS, SUBSTANCE USE, WANTING CHANGE, UNHEALTHY EATING AND HAVING TROUBLES WITH SLEEP. THEIR POSTS WERE ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH LINGUISTIC MARKERS OF ANGER, DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY. A RANDOM FOREST MODEL PREDICTED EXPRESSIONS OF LONELINESS ONLINE WITH AN AUC OF 0.86. CONCLUSIONS: USERS' TWITTER TIMELINES WITH THE WORDS LONELY OR ALONE OFTEN INCLUDE PSYCHOSOCIAL FEATURES AND CAN POTENTIALLY HAVE ASSOCIATIONS WITH HOW INDIVIDUALS EXPRESS AND EXPERIENCE LONELINESS. THIS CAN INFORM LOW-RESOURCE ONLINE ASSESSMENT FOR HIGH-RISK INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING LONELINESS AND INTERVENTIONS FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING MORBIDITIES IN THIS CONDITION.",0,1,0

NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) METHODS CAN BE USED TO AUTOMATICALLY EXTRACT CLINICALLY RELEVANT INFORMATION. OBJECTIVE: OUR AIM IS TO USE NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) TO CAPTURE REAL-WORLD DATA ON INDIVIDUALS WITH DEPRESSION FROM THE CLINICAL RECORD INTERACTIVE SEARCH (CRIS) CLINICAL TEXT TO FOSTER THE USE OF ELECTRONIC HEALTHCARE DATA IN MENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH. METHODS: WE USED A COMBINATION OF METHODS TO EXTRACT SALIENT INFORMATION FROM ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS. FIRST, CLINICAL EXPERTS DEFINE THE INFORMATION OF INTEREST AND SUBSEQUENTLY BUILD THE TRAINING AND TESTING CORPORA FOR STATISTICAL MODELS. SECOND, WE BUILT AND FINE-TUNED THE STATISTICAL MODELS USING ACTIVE LEARNING PROCEDURES. FINDINGS: RESULTS SHOW A HIGH DEGREE OF ACCURACY IN THE EXTRACTION OF DRUG-RELATED INFORMATION. CONTRASTINGLY, A MUCH LOWER DEGREE OF ACCURACY IS DEMONSTRATED IN RELATION TO AUXILIARY VARIABLES.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO ANALYZE THE SENTIMENT EXPRESSED IN MESSAGES ON DIABETES POSTED ON TWITTER. METHOD: TWEETS INCLUDING ONE OF THE TERMS ""DIABETES,"" ""T1D,"" AND/OR ""T2D"" WERE EXTRACTED FOR ONE WEEK USING THE TWITTER STANDARD API. ONLY THE TEXT MESSAGE AND THE NUMBER OF FOLLOWERS OF THE USERS WERE EXTRACTED. THE SENTIMENT ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED BY USING SENTISTRENGTH. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 67 421 TWEETS WERE AUTOMATICALLY EXTRACTED, OF THOSE 3.7% SPECIFICALLY REFERRED TO T1D; AND 6.8% SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED T2D. ONE OR MORE EMOJIS WERE INCLUDED IN 7.0% OF THE POSTS. TWEETS SPECIFICALLY MENTIONING T2D AND THAT DID NOT INCLUDE EMOJIS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE NEGATIVE THAN THE TWEETS THAT INCLUDED EMOJIS (-2.22 VS -1.48, P < .001).

INFORMATION IN THE CLINICAL NOTES OF THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD (EHR) MAY FURTHER AUGMENT THE IDENTIFICATION OF ALCOHOL MISUSE. NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) WITH SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT ANALYZING CLINICAL NOTES AND IDENTIFYING CASES OF ALCOHOL MISUSE IN TRAUMA PATIENTS. METHODS: AN ALCOHOL MISUSE NLP CLASSIFIER, PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED ON TRAUMA PATIENTS WHO COMPLETED THE ALCOHOL USE DISORDERS IDENTIFICATION TEST, WAS VALIDATED IN A COHORT OF 1000 HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS AT A LARGE, TERTIARY HEALTH SYSTEM BETWEEN JANUARY 1, 2007 AND SEPTEMBER 1, 2017. THE CLINICAL NOTES WERE PROCESSED USING THE CLINICAL TEXT ANALYSIS AND KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION SYSTEM. THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISM (NIAAA) GUIDELINES FOR ALCOHOL MISUSE WERE USED DURING ANNOTATION OF THE MEDICAL RECORDS IN OUR VALIDATION DATASET. RESULTS: THE ALCOHOL MISUSE CLASSIFIER HAD AN AREA UNDER THE RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC CURVE OF 0.91 (95% CI 0.90-0.93) IN THE COHORT OF HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS. THE SENSITIVITY, SPECIFICITY, POSITIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE, AND NEGATIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE WERE 0.88 (95% CI 0.85-0.90), 0.78 (95% CI 0.74-0.82), 0.85 (95% CI 0.82-0.87), AND 0.82 (95% CI 0.78-0.86), RESPECTIVELY.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS WERE >12 YEARS OLD WITH EPILEPSY. ALL PARTICIPANTS WERE INTERVIEWED USING THE MINI INTERNATIONAL NEUROPSYCHIATRIC INTERVIEW (MINI) OR THE MINI KID TRACKING AND ASKED FIVE OPEN-ENDED CONVERSATIONAL QUESTIONS. N-GRAMS AND LINGUISTIC INQUIRY AND WORD COUNT (LIWC) WORD CATEGORIES WERE USED TO CONSTRUCT MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFICATION MODELS FROM LANGUAGE HARVESTED FROM INTERVIEWS. DATA WERE ANALYZED FOR FOUR INDIVIDUAL MINI IDENTIFIED DISORDERS AND FOR THREE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE GROUPS: PARTICIPANTS WITH NO PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS, PARTICIPANTS WITH NON-SUICIDAL PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS, AND PARTICIPANTS WITH ANY DEGREE OF SUICIDALITY. PERFORMANCE WAS MEASURED USING AREAS UNDER THE RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC CURVE (AROCS). RESULTS: CLASSIFIERS WERE CONSTRUCTED FROM 227 INTERVIEWS WITH 122 PARTICIPANTS (7.5 3.1 MINUTES AND 454 299 WORDS). AROCS FOR MODELS DIFFERENTIATING THE NON-OVERLAPPING GROUPS AND INDIVIDUAL DISORDERS RANGED 57%-78% (MANY WITH P < .02).

WOMEN IN THE PERINATAL PERIOD (PREGNANT, BIRTHING, AND POSTPARTUM) HAVE UNIQUE AND TIMELY NEEDS FOR DIRECTIVES ON HEALTH, SAFETY, AND RISK AVERSION DURING PERIODS OF ISOLATION AND PHYSICAL DISTANCING FOR THEMSELVES, THEIR CHILD OR CHILDREN, AND OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS. IN ADDITION, THEY ARE A VULNERABLE GROUP AT INCREASED RISK OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS THAT MAY BE EXACERBATED IN THE CONTEXT OF SOCIAL SUPPORT DEPRIVATION AND A HIGH-RISK EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXAMINE THE PUBLIC DISCOURSE OF A PERINATAL COHORT TO UNDERSTAND UNMET HEALTH INFORMATION AND SUPPORT NEEDS, AND THE IMPACTS ON MOTHERING IDENTITY AND SOCIAL DYNAMICS IN THE CONTEXT OF COVID-19. METHODS: A LEADING AUSTRALIAN ONLINE SUPPORT FORUM FOR WOMEN PRE- THROUGH TO POSTBIRTH WAS USED TO INTERROGATE ALL POSTS RELATED TO COVID-19 FROM JANUARY 27 TO MAY 12, 2020, INCLUSIVE. KEY SEARCH TERMS INCLUDED ""COVID,"" ""CORONA,"" AND ""PANDEMIC."" A THREE-PHASE ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED, INCLUDING THEMATIC ANALYSIS, SENTIMENT ANALYSIS, AND WORD FREQUENCY CALCULATIONS. RESULTS: THE SEARCH YIELDED 960 POSTS, OF WHICH 831 WERE INCLUDED IN OUR ANALYSIS. THE QUALITATIVE THEMATIC ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATED REASONABLE UNDERSTANDING, INTERPRETATION, AND APPLICATION OF RELEVANT RESTRICTIONS IN PLACE, WITH FIVE EMERGING THEMES IDENTIFIED. THESE WERE (1) HEIGHTENED DISTRESS RELATED TO A HIGH-RISK EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT; (2) DESPAIR AND ANTICIPATORY GRIEF DUE TO DEPRIVATION OF SOCIAL AND FAMILY SUPPORT, AND BONDING RITUALS; (3) ALTERED FAMILY AND SUPPORT RELATIONSHIPS; (4) GUILT-TAMPERED HAPPINESS; AND (5) FAMILY FUTURE POSTPONED. SENTIMENT ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE CONTENT WAS PREDOMINANTLY NEGATIVE (VERY NEGATIVE: N=537 AND MODERATELY NEGATIVE: N=443 COMPARED TO VERY POSITIVE: N=236 AND MODERATELY POSITIVE: N=340). NEGATIVE WORDS WERE FREQUENTLY USED IN THE 831 POSTS WITH ASSOCIATED DERIVATIVES INCLUDING ""WORRIED"" (N=165, 19.9%), ""RISK"" (N=143, 17.2%), ""ANXIETY"" (N=98, 11.8%), ""CONCERNS"" (N=74, 8.8%), AND ""STRESS"" (N=69, 8.3%). CONCLUSIONS: WOMEN IN THE PERINATAL PERIOD ARE UNIQUELY IMPACTED BY THE CURRENT PANDEMIC. GENERAL INFORMATION ON COVID-19 SAFE BEHAVIORS DID NOT MEET THE PARTICULAR NEEDS OF THIS COHORT. THE LACK OF NUANCED AND TIMELY INFORMATION MAY EXACERBATE THE RISK OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL DISTRESS IN THIS VULNERABLE, HIGH-RISK GROUP.

HOWEVER, THE TRADITIONAL USE OF DIDACTIC LECTURES FOR COMMUNICATION SKILLS TRAINING IS INEFFECTIVE, AND THE USE OF STANDARDIZED PATIENTS IS NOT TIME- OR COST-EFFECTIVE. GIVEN THE ABILITIES OF VIRTUAL PATIENTS (VPS) TO SIMULATE INTERACTIVE AND AUTHENTIC CLINICAL SCENARIOS IN SECURED ENVIRONMENTS WITH UNLIMITED TRAINING ATTEMPTS, A VIRTUAL COUNSELING APPLICATION IS AN IDEAL PLATFORM FOR NURSING STUDENTS TO HONE THEIR COMMUNICATION SKILLS BEFORE THEIR CLINICAL POSTINGS. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DEVELOP AND TEST THE USE OF VPS TO BETTER PREPARE NURSING UNDERGRADUATES FOR COMMUNICATING WITH REAL-LIFE PATIENTS, THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS, AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS DURING THEIR CLINICAL POSTINGS. METHODS: THE STAGES OF THE CREATION OF VPS INCLUDED PREPARATION, DESIGN, AND DEVELOPMENT, FOLLOWED BY A TESTING PHASE BEFORE THE OFFICIAL IMPLEMENTATION. AN INITIAL VOICE CHATBOT WAS TRAINED USING A NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING ENGINE, GOOGLE CLOUD'S DIALOGFLOW, AND WAS LATER VISUALIZED INTO A THREE-DIMENSIONAL (3D) AVATAR FORM USING UNITY 3D. RESULTS: THE VPS INCLUDED FOUR CASE SCENARIOS THAT WERE CONGRUENT WITH THE NURSING UNDERGRADUATES' SEMESTERS' LEARNING OBJECTIVES: (1) ASSESSING THE PAIN EXPERIENCED BY A PREGNANT WOMAN, (2) TAKING THE HISTORY OF A DEPRESSED PATIENT, (3) ESCALATING A BLEEDING EPISODE OF A POSTOPERATIVE PATIENT TO A PHYSICIAN, AND (4) SHOWING EMPATHY TO A STRESSED-OUT FELLOW FINAL-YEAR NURSING STUDENT. CHALLENGES AROSE IN TERMS OF CONTENT DEVELOPMENT, TECHNOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS, AND EXPECTATIONS MANAGEMENT, WHICH CAN BE RESOLVED BY CONTINGENCY PLANNING, OPEN COMMUNICATION, CONSTANT PROGRAM UPDATES, REFINEMENT, AND TRAINING. CONCLUSIONS: THE CREATION OF VPS TO ASSIST IN NURSING STUDENTS' COMMUNICATION SKILLS TRAINING MAY PROVIDE AUTHENTIC LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS THAT ENHANCE STUDENTS' PERCEIVED SELF-EFFICACY AND CONFIDENCE IN EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION SKILLS.

DISTRIBUTED REPRESENTATION LEARNING MODELS OF WORDS AND DOCUMENTS, ONE OF NEURAL LANGUAGE MODELS, HAVE OVERCOME SOME LIMITS OF VECTOR SPACE MODELS SUCH AS BAG-OF-WORDS MODEL AND HAVE BEEN UTILIZED SUCCESSIVELY IN MANY NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TASKS INCLUDING SENTIMENT ANALYSIS. HOWEVER, BECAUSE SUCH MODELS LEARN THE EMBEDDINGS ONLY WITH A CONTEXT-BASED OBJECTIVE, IT IS HARD FOR EMBEDDINGS TO REFLECT THE SENTIMENT OF TEXTS. IN THIS RESEARCH, WE ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM BY INTRODUCING A SEMI-SUPERVISED SENTIMENT-DISCRIMINATIVE OBJECTIVE USING PARTIAL SENTIMENT INFORMATION OF DOCUMENTS. OUR METHOD NOT ONLY REFLECTS THE PARTIAL SENTIMENT INFORMATION, BUT ALSO PRESERVES LOCAL STRUCTURES INDUCED FROM ORIGINAL DISTRIBUTED REPRESENTATION LEARNING OBJECTIVES BY CONSIDERING ONLY SENTIMENT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN NEIGHBORING DOCUMENTS. USING REAL-WORLD DATASETS, THE PROPOSED METHOD HAS BEEN VALIDATED BY SENTIMENT VISUALIZATION AND CLASSIFICATION TASKS. THE VISUALIZATION RESULTS OF AMAZON REVIEW DATASETS DEMONSTRATE THE ENHANCEMENT OF THE SENTIMENT CLASS SEPARATION WHEN DOCUMENT REPRESENTATIONS OF OUR PROPOSED METHOD ARE COMPARED TO OTHER METHODS.

"229","Y W, 2019, ","BACKGROUND: AUTOMATIC CLINICAL TEXT CLASSIFICATION IS A NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) TECHNOLOGY THAT UNLOCKS INFORMATION EMBEDDED IN CLINICAL NARRATIVES. MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR CLINICAL TEXT CLASSIFICATION TASKS. HOWEVER, A SUCCESSFUL MACHINE LEARNING MODEL USUALLY REQUIRES EXTENSIVE HUMAN EFFORTS TO CREATE LABELED TRAINING DATA AND CONDUCT FEATURE ENGINEERING. IN THIS STUDY, WE PROPOSE A CLINICAL TEXT CLASSIFICATION PARADIGM USING WEAK SUPERVISION AND DEEP REPRESENTATION TO REDUCE THESE HUMAN EFFORTS. METHODS: WE DEVELOP A RULE-BASED NLP ALGORITHM TO AUTOMATICALLY GENERATE LABELS FOR THE TRAINING DATA, AND THEN USE THE PRE-TRAINED WORD EMBEDDINGS AS DEEP REPRESENTATION FEATURES FOR TRAINING MACHINE LEARNING MODELS. SINCE MACHINE LEARNING IS TRAINED ON LABELS GENERATED BY THE AUTOMATIC NLP ALGORITHM, THIS TRAINING PROCESS IS CALLED WEAK SUPERVISION. WE EVALUAT THE PARADIGM EFFECTIVENESS ON TWO INSTITUTIONAL CASE STUDIES AT MAYO CLINIC: SMOKING STATUS CLASSIFICATION AND PROXIMAL FEMUR (HIP) FRACTURE CLASSIFICATION, AND ONE CASE STUDY USING A PUBLIC DATASET: THE I2B2 2006 SMOKING STATUS CLASSIFICATION SHARED TASK. WE TEST FOUR WIDELY USED MACHINE LEARNING MODELS, NAMELY, SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM), RANDOM FOREST (RF), MULTILAYER PERCEPTRON NEURAL NETWORKS (MLPNN), AND CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNN), USING THIS PARADIGM. PRECISION, RECALL, AND F1 SCORE ARE USED AS METRICS TO EVALUATE PERFORMANCE. RESULTS: CNN ACHIEVES THE BEST PERFORMANCE IN BOTH INSTITUTIONAL TASKS (F1 SCORE: 0.92 FOR MAYO CLINIC SMOKING STATUS CLASSIFICATION AND 0.97 FOR FRACTURE CLASSIFICATION). WE SHOW THAT WORD EMBEDDINGS SIGNIFICANTLY OUTPERFORM TF-IDF AND TOPIC MODELING FEATURES IN THE PARADIGM, AND THAT CNN CAPTURES ADDITIONAL PATTERNS FROM THE WEAK SUPERVISION COMPARED TO THE RULE-BASED NLP ALGORITHMS. WE ALSO OBSERVE TWO DRAWBACKS OF THE PROPOSED PARADIGM THAT CNN IS MORE SENSITIVE TO THE SIZE OF TRAINING DATA, AND THAT THE PROPOSED PARADIGM MIGHT NOT BE EFFECTIVE FOR COMPLEX MULTICLASS CLASSIFICATION TASKS. CONCLUSION: THE PROPOSED CLINICAL TEXT CLASSIFICATION PARADIGM COULD REDUCE HUMAN EFFORTS OF LABELED TRAINING DATA CREATION AND FEATURE ENGINEERING FOR APPLYING MACHINE LEARNING TO CLINICAL TEXT CLASSIFICATION BY LEVERAGING WEAK SUPERVISION AND DEEP REPRESENTATION. THE EXPERIMENTAL EXPERIMENTS HAVE VALIDATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PARADIGM BY TWO INSTITUTIONAL AND ONE SHARED CLINICAL TEXT CLASSIFICATION TASKS.",0,1,0

METHODS: WE CREATED AND RELEASED THE REDDIT MENTAL HEALTH DATASET INCLUDING POSTS FROM 826,961 UNIQUE USERS FROM 2018 TO 2020. USING REGRESSION, WE ANALYZED TRENDS FROM 90 TEXT-DERIVED FEATURES SUCH AS SENTIMENT ANALYSIS, PERSONAL PRONOUNS, AND SEMANTIC CATEGORIES. USING SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING, WE CLASSIFIED POSTS INTO THEIR RESPECTIVE SUPPORT GROUPS AND INTERPRETED IMPORTANT FEATURES TO UNDERSTAND HOW DIFFERENT PROBLEMS MANIFEST IN LANGUAGE. WE APPLIED UNSUPERVISED METHODS SUCH AS TOPIC MODELING AND UNSUPERVISED CLUSTERING TO UNCOVER CONCERNS THROUGHOUT REDDIT BEFORE AND DURING THE PANDEMIC. RESULTS: WE FOUND THAT THE R/HEALTHANXIETY FORUM SHOWED SPIKES IN POSTS ABOUT COVID-19 EARLY ON IN JANUARY, APPROXIMATELY 2 MONTHS BEFORE OTHER SUPPORT GROUPS STARTED POSTING ABOUT THE PANDEMIC. THERE WERE MANY FEATURES THAT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED DURING COVID-19 FOR SPECIFIC GROUPS INCLUDING THE CATEGORIES ""ECONOMIC STRESS,"" ""ISOLATION,"" AND ""HOME,"" WHILE OTHERS SUCH AS ""MOTION"" SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED. WE FOUND THAT SUPPORT GROUPS RELATED TO ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER, EATING DISORDERS, AND ANXIETY SHOWED THE MOST NEGATIVE SEMANTIC CHANGE DURING THE PANDEMIC OUT OF ALL MENTAL HEALTH GROUPS. HEALTH ANXIETY EMERGED AS A GENERAL THEME ACROSS REDDIT THROUGH INDEPENDENT SUPERVISED AND UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING ANALYSES. FOR INSTANCE, WE PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT THE CONCERNS OF A DIVERSE SET OF INDIVIDUALS ARE CONVERGING IN THIS UNIQUE MOMENT OF HISTORY; WE DISCOVERED THAT THE MORE USERS POSTED ABOUT COVID-19, THE MORE LINGUISTICALLY SIMILAR (LESS DISTANT) THE MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT GROUPS BECAME TO R/HEALTHANXIETY (=-0.96, P<.001). USING UNSUPERVISED CLUSTERING, WE FOUND THE SUICIDALITY AND LONELINESS CLUSTERS MORE THAN DOUBLED IN THE NUMBER OF POSTS DURING THE PANDEMIC. SPECIFICALLY, THE SUPPORT GROUPS FOR BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER AND POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER BECAME SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUICIDALITY CLUSTER. FURTHERMORE, CLUSTERS SURROUNDING SELF-HARM AND ENTERTAINMENT EMERGED. CONCLUSIONS: BY USING A BROAD SET OF NLP TECHNIQUES AND ANALYZING A BASELINE OF PREPANDEMIC POSTS, WE UNCOVERED PATTERNS OF HOW SPECIFIC MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS MANIFEST IN LANGUAGE, IDENTIFIED AT-RISK USERS, AND REVEALED THE DISTRIBUTION OF CONCERNS ACROSS REDDIT, WHICH COULD HELP PROVIDE BETTER RESOURCES TO ITS MILLIONS OF USERS. WE THEN DEMONSTRATED THAT TEXTUAL ANALYSIS IS SENSITIVE TO UNCOVER MENTAL HEALTH COMPLAINTS AS THEY APPEAR IN REAL TIME, IDENTIFYING VULNERABLE GROUPS AND ALARMING THEMES DURING COVID-19, AND THUS MAY HAVE UTILITY DURING THE ONGOING PANDEMIC AND OTHER WORLD-CHANGING EVENTS SUCH AS ELECTIONS AND PROTESTS.",1,1,0

THE AUTHORS EXAMINED A LARGE BODY OF MESSAGES (TWEETS) RELATED TO PLASTIC SURGERY USING NOVEL TECHNIQUES OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING AND SENTIMENT ANALYSIS. METHODS: THE AUTHORS COLLECTED OVER 1 MILLION TWEETS WITH THE KEYWORDS ""PLASTIC,"" ""COSMETIC,"" ""AESTHETIC,"" AND ""RECONSTRUCTION"" SURGERY SPANNING FROM 2012 TO 2016 FROM THE TWITTER GARDENHOSE FEED.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: OUR SEARCH OF 1964 RECORDS FROM PUBMED AND EMBASE WAS NARROWED TO 27 ELIGIBLE ARTICLES. DATA RELATED TO THE PURPOSE, FREE-TEXT CORPUS, PATIENTS, SYMPTOMS, NLP METHODOLOGY, EVALUATION METRICS, AND QUALITY INDICATORS WERE EXTRACTED FOR EACH STUDY. RESULTS: SYMPTOM-RELATED INFORMATION WAS PRESENTED AS A PRIMARY OUTCOME IN 14 STUDIES. EHR NARRATIVES REPRESENTED VARIOUS INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT CLINICAL SPECIALTIES, WITH GENERAL, CARDIOLOGY, AND MENTAL HEALTH OCCURRING MOST FREQUENTLY. STUDIES ENCOMPASSED A WIDE VARIETY OF SYMPTOMS, INCLUDING SHORTNESS OF BREATH, PAIN, NAUSEA, DIZZINESS, DISTURBED SLEEP, CONSTIPATION, AND DEPRESSED MOOD. NLP APPROACHES INCLUDED PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED NLP TOOLS, CLASSIFICATION METHODS, AND MANUALLY CURATED RULE-BASED PROCESSING. ONLY ONE-THIRD (N = 9) OF STUDIES REPORTED PATIENT DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS. DISCUSSION: NLP IS USED TO EXTRACT INFORMATION FROM EHR FREE-TEXT NARRATIVES WRITTEN BY A VARIETY OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS ON AN EXPANSIVE RANGE OF SYMPTOMS ACROSS DIVERSE CLINICAL SPECIALTIES. THE CURRENT FOCUS OF THIS FIELD IS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF METHODS TO EXTRACT SYMPTOM INFORMATION AND THE USE OF SYMPTOM INFORMATION FOR DISEASE CLASSIFICATION TASKS RATHER THAN THE EXAMINATION OF SYMPTOMS THEMSELVES.

OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS REVIEW WAS TO EXPLORE THE SCOPE AND LIMITS OF CUTTING-EDGE TECHNIQUES THAT RESEARCHERS ARE USING FOR PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS IN MENTAL HEALTH AND TO REVIEW ASSOCIATED ISSUES, SUCH AS ETHICAL CONCERNS, IN THIS AREA OF RESEARCH. METHODS: WE PERFORMED A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW IN MARCH 2017, USING KEYWORDS TO SEARCH ARTICLES ON DATA MINING OF SOCIAL NETWORK DATA IN THE CONTEXT OF COMMON MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS, PUBLISHED BETWEEN 2010 AND MARCH 8, 2017 IN MEDICAL AND COMPUTER SCIENCE JOURNALS. RESULTS: THE INITIAL SEARCH RETURNED A TOTAL OF 5386 ARTICLES. FOLLOWING A CAREFUL ANALYSIS OF THE TITLES, ABSTRACTS, AND MAIN TEXTS, WE SELECTED 48 ARTICLES FOR REVIEW. WE CODED THE ARTICLES ACCORDING TO KEY CHARACTERISTICS, TECHNIQUES USED FOR DATA COLLECTION, DATA PREPROCESSING, FEATURE EXTRACTION, FEATURE SELECTION, MODEL CONSTRUCTION, AND MODEL VERIFICATION. THE MOST COMMON ANALYTICAL METHOD WAS TEXT ANALYSIS, WITH SEVERAL STUDIES USING DIFFERENT FLAVORS OF IMAGE ANALYSIS AND SOCIAL INTERACTION GRAPH ANALYSIS. CONCLUSIONS: DESPITE AN INCREASING NUMBER OF STUDIES INVESTIGATING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES USING SOCIAL NETWORK DATA, SOME COMMON PROBLEMS PERSIST.

WE SAMPLE AND ANALYZE THE WEIBO POSTS FROM 17,865 ACTIVE WEIBO USERS USING THE APPROACH OF ONLINE ECOLOGICAL RECOGNITION (OER) BASED ON SEVERAL MACHINE-LEARNING PREDICTIVE MODELS. WE CALCULATED WORD FREQUENCY, SCORES OF EMOTIONAL INDICATORS (E.G., ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, INDIGNATION, AND OXFORD HAPPINESS) AND COGNITIVE INDICATORS (E.G., SOCIAL RISK JUDGMENT AND LIFE SATISFACTION) FROM THE COLLECTED DATA. THE SENTIMENT ANALYSIS AND THE PAIRED SAMPLE T-TEST WERE PERFORMED TO EXAMINE THE DIFFERENCES IN THE SAME GROUP BEFORE AND AFTER THE DECLARATION OF COVID-19 ON 20 JANUARY, 2020. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT NEGATIVE EMOTIONS (E.G., ANXIETY, DEPRESSION AND INDIGNATION) AND SENSITIVITY TO SOCIAL RISKS INCREASED, WHILE THE SCORES OF POSITIVE EMOTIONS (E.G., OXFORD HAPPINESS) AND LIFE SATISFACTION DECREASED. PEOPLE WERE CONCERNED MORE ABOUT THEIR HEALTH AND FAMILY, WHILE LESS ABOUT LEISURE AND FRIENDS. THE RESULTS CONTRIBUTE TO THE KNOWLEDGE GAPS OF SHORT-TERM INDIVIDUAL CHANGES IN PSYCHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS AFTER THE OUTBREAK.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF MOOD INSTABILITY ON CLINICAL OUTCOMES IN A LARGE SAMPLE OF PEOPLE RECEIVING SECONDARY MENTAL HEALTHCARE. DESIGN: OBSERVATIONAL STUDY USING AN ANONYMISED ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD CASE REGISTER. SETTING: SOUTH LONDON AND MAUDSLEY NHS TRUST (SLAM), A LARGE PROVIDER OF INPATIENT AND COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTHCARE IN THE UK. PARTICIPANTS: 27,704 ADULTS PRESENTING TO SLAM BETWEEN APRIL 2006 AND MARCH 2013 WITH A PSYCHOTIC, AFFECTIVE OR PERSONALITY DISORDER. EXPOSURE: THE PRESENCE OF MOOD INSTABILITY WITHIN 1MONTH OF PRESENTATION, IDENTIFIED USING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: THE NUMBER OF DAYS SPENT IN HOSPITAL, FREQUENCY OF HOSPITAL ADMISSION, COMPULSORY HOSPITAL ADMISSION AND PRESCRIPTION OF ANTIPSYCHOTICS OR NON-ANTIPSYCHOTIC MOOD STABILISERS OVER A 5-YEAR FOLLOW-UP PERIOD. RESULTS: MOOD INSTABILITY WAS DOCUMENTED IN 12.1% OF PEOPLE PRESENTING TO MENTAL HEALTHCARE SERVICES. IT WAS MOST FREQUENTLY DOCUMENTED IN PEOPLE WITH BIPOLAR DISORDER (22.6%), BUT WAS COMMON IN PEOPLE WITH PERSONALITY DISORDER (17.8%) AND SCHIZOPHRENIA (15.5%). IT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A GREATER NUMBER OF DAYS SPENT IN HOSPITAL ( COEFFICIENT 18.5, 95% CI 12.1 TO 24.8), GREATER FREQUENCY OF HOSPITALISATION (INCIDENCE RATE RATIO 1.95, 1.75 TO 2.17), GREATER LIKELIHOOD OF COMPULSORY ADMISSION (OR 2.73, 2.34 TO 3.19) AND AN INCREASED LIKELIHOOD OF PRESCRIPTION OF ANTIPSYCHOTICS (2.03, 1.75 TO 2.35) OR NON-ANTIPSYCHOTIC MOOD STABILISERS (2.07, 1.77 TO 2.41). CONCLUSIONS: MOOD INSTABILITY OCCURS IN A WIDE RANGE OF MENTAL DISORDERS AND IS NOT LIMITED TO AFFECTIVE DISORDERS. IT IS GENERALLY ASSOCIATED WITH RELATIVELY POOR CLINICAL OUTCOMES. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT CLINICIANS SHOULD SCREEN FOR MOOD INSTABILITY ACROSS ALL COMMON MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS. THE DATA ALSO SUGGEST THAT TARGETED INTERVENTIONS FOR MOOD INSTABILITY MAY BE USEFUL IN PATIENTS WHO DO NOT HAVE A FORMAL AFFECTIVE DISORDER.",0,1,0

THIS STUDY SUMMARIZES OUR EFFORTS AND RESULTS IN PROPOSING A NOVEL DATA USE CASE FOR THIS DATASET AS PART OF THE THIRD TRACK IN THIS SHARED TASK. OBJECTIVE: WE EXPLORE THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF PREDICTING A SET OF COMMON MENTAL CONDITIONS A PATIENT HAS BASED ON THE SHORT TEXTUAL DESCRIPTION OF PATIENT'S HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS TYPICALLY OCCURRING IN THE BEGINNING OF A PSYCHIATRIC INITIAL EVALUATION NOTE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: WE CLEAN AND PROCESS THE 1000 RECORDS MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE N-GRID CLINICAL NLP TASK INTO A KEY-VALUE DICTIONARY AND BUILD A DATASET OF 986 EXAMPLES FOR WHICH THERE IS A NARRATIVE FOR HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS AS WELL AS YES/NO RESPONSES WITH REGARDS TO PRESENCE OF SPECIFIC MENTAL CONDITIONS.

WE CONDUCT EXPERIMENTS TO COMPARE THESE METHODS TO EACH OTHER AND TO BASELINES BASED ON LINEAR MODELS AND NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION (NER). RESULTS: OUR CNN MODEL WITH OPTIMIZED THRESHOLDING OF OUTPUT PROBABILITY ESTIMATES ACHIEVES BEST OVERALL MEAN MICRO-F SCORE OF 63.144% FOR 11 COMMON MENTAL CONDITIONS WITH STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT GAINS (P<0.05) OVER ALL OTHER MODELS.

RESEARCH DESIGN: RETROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY OF MST DISCLOSURES IN A NATIONAL, RANDOM SAMPLE OF VETERANS WHO SERVED IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ AND COMPLETED MST SCREENS FROM OCTOBER 2009 TO 2014. WE USED NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) TO EXTRACT MST CONCEPTS FROM ELECTRONIC MEDICAL NOTES IN THE YEAR FOLLOWING VETERANS' FIRST MST SCREEN. MEASURE(S): ANY EVIDENCE OF MST (POSITIVE MST SCREEN OR NLP CONCEPTS) AND LATE MST DISCLOSURE (NLP CONCEPTS FOLLOWING A NEGATIVE MST SCREEN). MULTIVARIABLE LOGISTIC REGRESSIONS, STRATIFIED BY SEX, TESTED RACIAL/ETHNIC DIFFERENCES IN ANY MST EVIDENCE, AND LATE DISCLOSURE. RESULTS: OF 6618 MALE AND 6716 FEMALE VETERANS WITH MST SCREEN RESULTS, 1473 HAD A POSITIVE SCREEN (68 MALE, 1%; 1405 FEMALE, 21%). OF THOSE WITH A NEGATIVE SCREEN, 257 EVIDENCED LATE MST DISCLOSURE BY NLP (44 MALE, 39%; 213 FEMALE, 13%). LATE MST DISCLOSURE WAS USUALLY DOCUMENTED DURING MENTAL HEALTH VISITS. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT RACIAL/ETHNIC DIFFERENCES IN MST DISCLOSURE AMONG MEN. AMONG WOMEN, BLACKS WERE LESS LIKELY THAN WHITES TO HAVE ANY MST EVIDENCE (ADJUSTED ODDS RATIO=0.75).

EXPERIENCED CLINICIANS REVIEWED CHARTS TO IDENTIFY TEXT FEATURES AND CODED DATA CONSISTENT OR INCONSISTENT WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF BIPOLAR DISORDER. NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING WAS USED TO TRAIN A DIAGNOSTIC ALGORITHM WITH 95% SPECIFICITY FOR CLASSIFYING BIPOLAR DISORDER. FILTERED CODED DATA WERE USED TO DERIVE THREE ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION RULES FOR CASE SUBJECTS AND ONE FOR CONTROL SUBJECTS. THE POSITIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE (PPV) OF EHR-BASED BIPOLAR DISORDER AND SUBPHENOTYPE DIAGNOSES WAS CALCULATED AGAINST DIAGNOSES FROM DIRECT SEMISTRUCTURED INTERVIEWS OF 190 PATIENTS BY TRAINED CLINICIANS BLIND TO EHR DIAGNOSIS. RESULTS: THE PPV OF BIPOLAR DISORDER DEFINED BY NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING WAS 0.85. CODED CLASSIFICATION BASED ON STRICT FILTERING ACHIEVED A VALUE OF 0.79, BUT CLASSIFICATIONS BASED ON LESS STRINGENT CRITERIA PERFORMED LESS WELL. NO EHR-CLASSIFIED CONTROL SUBJECT RECEIVED A DIAGNOSIS OF BIPOLAR DISORDER ON THE BASIS OF DIRECT INTERVIEW (PPV=1.0). FOR MOST SUBPHENOTYPES, VALUES EXCEEDED 0.80.

FIRSTLY, THE CASUAL USE OF CHINESE ABBREVIATIONS AND DOCTORS' PERSONAL STYLE MAY RESULT IN MULTIPLE EXPRESSIONS OF THE SAME ENTITY, AND WE LACK A COMMON CHINESE MEDICAL DICTIONARY TO PERFORM ACCURATE ENTITY EXTRACTION. SECONDLY, THE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD CONTAINS ENTITIES FROM A VARIETY OF CATEGORIES OF ENTITIES, AND THE LENGTH OF THOSE ENTITIES IN DIFFERENT CATEGORIES VARIES GREATLY, WHICH INCREASES THE DIFFICULT IN THE EXTRACTION FOR THE CHINESE NER. THEREFORE, THE ENTITY BOUNDARY DETECTION BECOMES THE KEY TO PERFORM ACCURATE ENTITY EXTRACTION OF CHINESE EMRS, AND WE NEED TO DEVELOP A MODEL THAT SUPPORTS MULTIPLE LENGTH ENTITY RECOGNITION WITHOUT RELYING ON ANY MEDICAL DICTIONARY. METHODS: IN THIS STUDY, WE INCORPORATE PART-OF-SPEECH (POS) INFORMATION INTO THE DEEP LEARNING MODEL TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF CHINESE ENTITY BOUNDARY DETECTION. IN ORDER TO AVOID THE WRONGLY POS TAGGING OF LONG ENTITIES, WE PROPOSED A METHOD CALLED REDUCED POS TAGGING THAT RESERVES THE TAGS OF GENERAL WORDS BUT NOT OF THE SEEMINGLY MEDICAL ENTITIES. THE MODEL PROPOSED IN THIS PAPER, NAMED SM-LSTM-CRF, CONSISTS OF THREE LAYERS: SELF-MATCHING ATTENTION LAYER - CALCULATING THE RELEVANCE OF EACH CHARACTER TO THE ENTIRE SENTENCE; LSTM (LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY) LAYER - CAPTURING THE CONTEXT FEATURE OF EACH CHARACTER; CRF (CONDITIONAL RANDOM FIELD) LAYER - LABELING CHARACTERS BASED ON THEIR FEATURES AND TRANSFER RULES.

HOWEVER, RECENT ADVANCES IN DEEP LEARNING AND NLP ENABLE MODELS TO LEARN A RICH REPRESENTATION OF (MEDICAL) LANGUAGE. CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNN) FOR TEXT CLASSIFICATION CAN AUGMENT THE EXISTING TECHNIQUES BY LEVERAGING THE REPRESENTATION OF LANGUAGE TO LEARN WHICH PHRASES IN A TEXT ARE RELEVANT FOR A GIVEN MEDICAL CONDITION.

RESULTS: OF 102 STUDENTS APPROACHED, 66 STUDENTS CONSENTED AND ENROLLED. THE SYSTEM SENT 393 EMAIL ALERTS TO 54 STUDENTS (82%), INCLUDING 270 FOR AD AND 123 FOR AMS. PRECISION WAS 100% FOR AD AND 93% FOR AMS. RECALL WAS 69% FOR AD AND 100% FOR AMS. STUDENTS MENTIONED ADS FOR 43 PATIENTS, WITH ALL MENTIONS OCCURRING AFTER FIRST HAVING RECEIVED AN AD REMINDER. STUDENTS ACCESSED EDUCATIONAL LINKS 34 TIMES FROM THE 393 EMAIL ALERTS. THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN PRE (MEAN 62%) AND POST (MEAN 60%) TEST SCORES. CONCLUSIONS: THE SYSTEM EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFIED TWO EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES USING NLP APPLIED TO CLINICAL NOTES AND DEMONSTRATED A SMALL CHANGE IN STUDENT BEHAVIOR. USE OF ELECTRONIC ADVISORS SUCH AS THESE MAY PROVIDE A SCALABLE MODEL TO ASSESS SPECIFIC COMPETENCY ELEMENTS AND DELIVER EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES.",0,1,0

METHODS: WE APPLIED A NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TOOL TO SCORE THE SENTIMENT EXPRESSED IN WEB SEARCH RESULTS FOR 51 PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATIONS ACROSS 3 DRUG CLASSES (ANTIDEPRESSANTS, ANTIPSYCHOTICS, AND MOOD STABILIZERS), AS A MEANS OF SEEING IF ARTICLES REFERENCING THESE MEDICATIONS WERE GENERALLY POSITIVE OR GENERALLY NEGATIVE IN TONE. WE COMPARED BETWEEN MEDICATIONS OF THE SAME CLASS, AND ACROSS MEDICATION CLASSES. RESULTS: ACROSS 12,733 WEB SEARCH RESULTS, SIGNIFICANT WITHIN-CLASS DIFFERENCES IN POSITIVE (ANTIDEPRESSANTS: F(24,2682) = 2.97, P < 0.001; ANTIPSYCHOTICS: F(16,4029) = 3.25, P < 0.001; MOOD STABILIZERS: F(8,2371) = 6.88, P < 0.001) AND NEGATIVE SENTIMENT (ANTIDEPRESSANTS: F(24,6282) = 11.17, P < 0.001; ANTIPSYCHOTICS: F(16, 4029) = 12.13, P < 0.001; MOOD STABILIZERS: F(8, 2371) = 13.28, P < 0.001) WERE IDENTIFIED. AMONG THESE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER NEGATIVE SENTIMENT FOR THE ANTIDEPRESSANTS SERTRALINE, DULOXETINE, VENLAFAXINE, AND PAROXETINE, AND FOR THE ANTIPSYCHOTICS, QUETIAPINE AND RISPERIDONE. CONVERSELY, LITHIUM PREPARATIONS AND VALPROATE EXHIBITED LESS NEGATIVE SENTIMENT THAN OTHER MOOD STABILIZING MEDICATIONS. LIMITATIONS: WHILE THESE RESULTS PROVIDE A NOVEL MEANS OF COMPARING MEDICATIONS, THE PRESENT ANALYSES CANNOT BE LINKED TO INDIVIDUAL PATIENT CONSUMPTION OF THIS INFORMATION, OR TO ITS INFLUENCE ON THEIR FUTURE CLINICAL INTERACTIONS. CONCLUSIONS: OVERALL, A SUBSET OF PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATIONS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANTLY MORE NEGATIVE SENTIMENT.

HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF ASSESSOR BIAS ANALYZING THESE WRITINGS QUALITATIVELY TO GENERALIZE LEARNER EXPERIENCES MAY BE PROBLEMATIC. THIS STUDY USES A PROCESS-ORIENTED TEXT MINING APPROACH TO BETTER UNDERSTAND MEANINGS OF LEARNER EXPERIENCES BY CONNECTING KEY CONCEPTS IN EXTENDED STUDENT REFLECTIVE ESSAYS. METHODS: TEXT MINING QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS IS USED ON SELF-EVALUATIVE ESSAYS (N = 47, UNIQUE WORD COUNT RANGE 43-575) BY FIFTH-YEAR STUDENTS AT A REGIONAL QUOTA-SYSTEM UNIVERSITY IN JAPAN THAT SPECIALIZES IN TRAINING GENERAL PRACTITIONERS FOR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. FIRST, SIX HIGHLY-OCCURRING KEY WORDS WERE IDENTIFIED: PATIENT, SYSTEMIC TREATMENT, LOCALE, HOSPITAL, CARE, AND TRAINING. THEN, STANDARDIZED KEYWORD FREQUENCY ANALYSIS ROBUST TO OVERALL ESSAY LENGTH AND KEYWORD VOLUME USED INDIVIDUAL KEYWORDS AS ""NODES"" TO CALCULATE PER-KEYWORD VALUES FOR EACH ESSAY. FINALLY, PRINCIPLE COMPONENTS ANALYSIS AND REGRESSION WERE USED TO ANALYZE KEY WORD RELATIONSHIPS. RESULTS: COMPONENT LOADINGS WERE STRONGEST FOR THE KEYWORD AREA, INDICATING MOST SHARED VARIANCE. MULTIPLY REGRESSING THREE OF THE REMAINING KEYWORDS HOSPITAL, SYSTEMIC TREATMENT, AND TRAINING YIELDED R(2) = 0.45, CONSIDERED HIGH FOR THIS EXPLORATORY STUDY. IN CONTRAST, DIRECT PATIENT EXPERIENCE FOR STUDENTS WAS DIFFICULT TO GENERALIZE. CONCLUSIONS: IMPRESSIONS OF THE PRACTICING AREA ENVIRONMENT WERE STRONGEST IN STUDENTS, AND THESE IMPRESSIONS WERE INFLUENCED BY HOSPITAL WORKPLACE, TREATMENT PROVISION, AND TRAINING. TEXT MINING CAN EXTRACT INFORMATION FROM LARGER SAMPLES OF STUDENT ESSAYS IN AN EFFICIENT AND OBJECTIVE MANNER, AS WELL AS IDENTIFY PATTERNS BETWEEN LEARNING SITUATIONS TO CREATE MODELS OF THE LEARNING EXPERIENCE.

METHODS: WE USED A COHORT OF VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (VHA) USERS DIAGNOSED WITH POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) BETWEEN 2004-2013. USING A CASE-CONTROL DESIGN, CASES (THOSE THAT DIED BY SUICIDE DURING THE YEAR FOLLOWING DIAGNOSIS) WERE MATCHED TO CONTROLS (THOSE THAT REMAINED ALIVE). AFTER SELECTING CONDITIONAL MATCHES BASED ON HAVING SHARED MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS, WE CHOSE CONTROLS USING A 5:1 NEAREST-NEIGHBOR PROPENSITY MATCH BASED ON THE VHA'S STRUCTURED ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS (EMR)-BASED SUICIDE PREDICTION MODEL. FOR CASES, PSYCHOTHERAPIST NOTES WERE COLLECTED FROM DIAGNOSIS UNTIL DEATH. FOR CONTROLS, PSYCHOTHERAPIST NOTES WERE COLLECTED FROM DIAGNOSIS UNTIL MATCHED CASE'S DATE OF DEATH. AFTER ENSURING SIMILAR NUMBERS OF NOTES, THE FINAL SAMPLE INCLUDED 246 CASES AND 986 CONTROLS. NOTES WERE ANALYZED USING SENTIMENT ANALYSIS AND COGNITION ENGINE, A PYTHON-BASED NLP PACKAGE. THE OUTPUT WAS EVALUATED USING MACHINE-LEARNING ALGORITHMS. THE AREA UNDER THE CURVE (AUC) WAS CALCULATED TO DETERMINE MODELS' PREDICTIVE ACCURACY. RESULTS: NLP DERIVED VARIABLES OFFERED SMALL BUT SIGNIFICANT PREDICTIVE IMPROVEMENT (AUC = 0.58) FOR PATIENTS THAT HAD LONGER TREATMENT DURATION. A SMALL SAMPLE SIZE LIMITED PREDICTIVE ACCURACY. CONCLUSIONS: STUDY IDENTIFIES A NOVEL METHOD FOR MEASURING SUICIDE RISK OVER TIME AND POTENTIALLY CATEGORIZING PATIENT SUBGROUPS WITH DISTINCT RISK SENSITIVITIES. FINDINGS SUGGEST LEVERAGING NLP DERIVED VARIABLES FROM PSYCHOTHERAPY NOTES OFFERS AN ADDITIONAL PREDICTIVE VALUE OVER AND ABOVE THE VHA'S STATE-OF-THE-ART STRUCTURED EMR-BASED SUICIDE PREDICTION MODEL.

OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMED TO CONSIDER THE RAW FREQUENCIES OF WORDS IN THE COLLECTION OF TWEETS POSTED BY A SAMPLE OF STROKE SURVIVORS AND TO COMPARE THE POSTS BY GENDER OF THE SURVIVOR FOR 8 BASIC EMOTIONS (ANGER, FEAR, ANTICIPATION, SURPRISE, JOY, SADNESS, TRUST AND DISGUST); DETERMINE THE PROPORTION OF EACH EMOTION IN THE COLLECTION OF TWEETS AND STATISTICALLY COMPARE EACH OF THEM BY GENDER OF THE SURVIVOR; EXTRACT THE MAIN TOPICS (REPRESENTED AS SETS OF WORDS) THAT OCCUR IN THE COLLECTION OF TWEETS, RELATIVE TO EACH GENDER; AND ASSIGN HAPPINESS SCORES TO TWEETS AND TOPICS (USING A WELL-ESTABLISHED TOOL) AND COMPARE THEM BY GENDER OF THE SURVIVOR. METHODS: WE PERFORMED SENTIMENT ANALYSIS BASED ON A STATE-OF-THE-ART LEXICON (NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL) WITH SYUZHET R PACKAGE. THE EMOTION SCORES FOR MEN AND WOMEN WERE FIRST SUBJECTED TO AN F-TEST AND THEN TO A WILCOXON RANK SUM TEST. WE EXTENDED THE EMOTIONAL ANALYSIS, ASSIGNING HAPPINESS SCORES WITH THE HEDONOMETER (A TOOL SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED CONSIDERING TWITTER INPUTS). WE CALCULATED DAILY HAPPINESS AVERAGE SCORES FOR ALL TWEETS. WE CREATED A TERM MAP FOR AN EXPLORATORY CLUSTERING ANALYSIS USING VOSVIEWER SOFTWARE. WE PERFORMED STRUCTURAL TOPIC MODELLING WITH STM R PACKAGE, ALLOWING US TO IDENTIFY MAIN TOPICS BY GENDER. WE ASSIGNED HAPPINESS SCORES TO ALL THE WORDS DEFINING THE MAIN IDENTIFIED TOPICS AND COMPARED THEM BY GENDER. RESULTS: WE ANALYZED 800,424 TWEETS POSTED FROM AUGUST 1, 2007 TO DECEMBER 1, 2018, BY 479 STROKE SURVIVORS: WOMEN (N=244) POSTED 396,898 TWEETS, AND MEN (N=235) POSTED 403,526 TWEETS. THE STROKE SURVIVOR CONDITION AND GENDER AS WELL AS MEMBERSHIP IN AT LEAST 3 STROKE-SPECIFIC TWITTER LISTS OF ACTIVE USERS WERE MANUALLY VERIFIED FOR ALL 479 PARTICIPANTS. THEIR TOTAL NUMBER OF TWEETS SINCE 2007 WAS 5,257,433; THEREFORE, WE ANALYZED THE MOST RECENT 15.2% OF ALL THEIR TWEETS. POSITIVE EMOTIONS (ANTICIPATION, TRUST, AND JOY) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER (P<.001) IN WOMEN, WHILE NEGATIVE EMOTIONS (DISGUST, FEAR, AND SADNESS) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER (P<.001) IN MEN IN THE ANALYSIS OF RAW FREQUENCIES AND PROPORTION OF EMOTIONS. HAPPINESS MEAN SCORES THROUGHOUT THE CONSIDERED PERIOD SHOW HIGHER LEVELS OF HAPPINESS IN WOMEN. WE CALCULATED THE TOP 20 TOPICS (WITH PERCENTAGES AND CIS) MORE LIKELY ADDRESSED BY GENDER AND FOUND THAT WOMEN'S TOPICS SHOW HIGHER LEVELS OF HAPPINESS SCORES.

THIS STUDY AIMED TO EVALUATE THE ACCURACY OF DIAGNOSTIC CODES AND USE TEXT MINING TO EXTRACT SYMPTOM PROFILE AND FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENT FROM ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHRS) TO OVERCOME THE ABOVE RESEARCH LIMITATIONS. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 500 DISCHARGE NOTES WERE RANDOMLY SELECTED FROM A MEDICAL CENTER'S DATABASE. THREE ANNOTATORS REVIEWED THE NOTES TO ESTABLISH GOLD STANDARDS. THE ACCURACY OF DIAGNOSTIC CODES FOR MAJOR PSYCHIATRIC ILLNESS WAS EVALUATED. TEXT MINING APPROACHES WERE APPLIED TO EXTRACT DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND FUNCTION PROFILES AND TO IDENTIFY PATIENTS WITH MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER. RESULTS: THE ACCURACY OF THE DIAGNOSTIC CODE FOR MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER, SCHIZOPHRENIA, AND DEMENTIA WAS ACCEPTABLE BUT THAT OF BIPOLAR DISORDER AND MINOR DEPRESSION WAS LESS SATISFACTORY. THE PERFORMANCE OF TEXT MINING APPROACH TO RECOGNIZE DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS IS SATISFACTORY; HOWEVER, THE RECALL FOR FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENT IS LOWER RESULTING IN LOWER F-SCORES OF 0.774-0.753.

THE STUDY OF SOCIAL REMINISCENCE BEHAVIOR IN EVERYDAY LIFE CAN BE USED TO GENERATE DATA AND DETECT REMINISCENCE FROM GENERAL CONVERSATIONS. OBJECTIVE: THE AIMS OF THIS ORIGINAL PAPER ARE TO (1) PREPROCESS CODED TRANSCRIPTS OF CONVERSATIONS IN GERMAN OF OLDER ADULTS WITH NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP), AND (2) IMPLEMENT AND EVALUATE LEARNING STRATEGIES USING DIFFERENT NLP FEATURES AND MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS TO DETECT REMINISCENCE IN A CORPUS OF TRANSCRIPTS. METHODS: THE METHODS IN THIS STUDY COMPRISE (1) COLLECTING AND CODING OF TRANSCRIPTS OF OLDER ADULTS' CONVERSATIONS IN GERMAN, (2) PREPROCESSING TRANSCRIPTS TO GENERATE NLP FEATURES (BAG-OF-WORDS MODELS, PART-OF-SPEECH TAGS, PRETRAINED GERMAN WORD EMBEDDINGS), AND (3) TRAINING MACHINE LEARNING MODELS TO DETECT REMINISCENCE USING RANDOM FORESTS, SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES, AND ADAPTIVE AND EXTREME GRADIENT BOOSTING ALGORITHMS. THE DATA SET COMPRISES 2214 TRANSCRIPTS, INCLUDING 109 TRANSCRIPTS WITH REMINISCENCE. DUE TO CLASS IMBALANCE IN THE DATA, WE INTRODUCED THREE LEARNING STRATEGIES: (1) CLASS-WEIGHTED LEARNING, (2) A META-CLASSIFIER CONSISTING OF A VOTING ENSEMBLE, AND (3) DATA AUGMENTATION WITH THE SYNTHETIC MINORITY OVERSAMPLING TECHNIQUE (SMOTE) ALGORITHM. FOR EACH LEARNING STRATEGY, WE PERFORMED CROSS-VALIDATION ON A RANDOM SAMPLE OF THE TRAINING DATA SET OF TRANSCRIPTS. WE COMPUTED THE AREA UNDER THE CURVE (AUC), THE AVERAGE PRECISION (AP), PRECISION, RECALL, AS WELL AS F1 SCORE AND SPECIFICITY MEASURES ON THE TEST DATA, FOR ALL COMBINATIONS OF NLP FEATURES, ALGORITHMS, AND LEARNING STRATEGIES. RESULTS: CLASS-WEIGHTED SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES ON BAG-OF-WORDS FEATURES OUTPERFORMED ALL OTHER CLASSIFIERS (AUC=0.91, AP=0.56, PRECISION=0.5, RECALL=0.45, F1=0.48, SPECIFICITY=0.98), FOLLOWED BY SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES ON SMOTE-AUGMENTED DATA AND WORD EMBEDDINGS FEATURES (AUC=0.89, AP=0.54, PRECISION=0.35, RECALL=0.59, F1=0.44, SPECIFICITY=0.94). FOR THE META-CLASSIFIER STRATEGY, ADAPTIVE AND EXTREME GRADIENT BOOSTING ALGORITHMS TRAINED ON WORD EMBEDDINGS AND BAG-OF-WORDS OUTPERFORMED ALL OTHER CLASSIFIERS AND NLP FEATURES; HOWEVER, THE PERFORMANCE OF THE META-CLASSIFIER LEARNING STRATEGY WAS LOWER COMPARED TO OTHER STRATEGIES, WITH HIGHLY IMBALANCED PRECISION-RECALL TRADE-OFFS.

UNFORTUNATELY, MANY OF THESE FACTORS ARE NOT DIRECTLY OBSERVABLE AND QUANTIFYING, AND ASSESSING THEIR IMPACT CAN BE DIFFICULT. BASED ON SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS OF USERS ENGAGED IN SUBSTANCE USE AND RECOVERY ON THE FORUM REDDIT, WE EMPLOYED TWO PSYCHOLINGUISTIC TOOLS, LINGUISTIC INQUIRY AND WORD COUNT AND EMPATH AND ACTIVITIES OF SUBSTANCE USERS ON VARIOUS REDDIT SUB-FORUMS TO ANALYZE BEHAVIOR UNDERLINING ADDICTION RECOVERY AND RELAPSE. WE THEN EMPLOYED A STATISTICAL ANALYSIS TECHNIQUE CALLED STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF THESE LATENT FACTORS ON RECOVERY AND RELAPSE. RESULTS: WE FOUND THAT BOTH EMOTIONAL DISTRESS AND PHYSICAL PAIN SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE ADDICTION RECOVERY BEHAVIOR. SELF-DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AND SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS OF THE SUBSTANCE USERS WERE ALSO FOUND TO ENABLE RECOVERY. FURTHERMORE, WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF SELF-DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, THOSE THAT WERE RELATED TO INFLUENCING THE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL WELL-BEING OF SUBSTANCE USERS WERE FOUND TO BE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH ADDICTION RECOVERY. WE ALSO DETERMINED THAT LACK OF SOCIAL ACTIVITIES AND PHYSICAL EXERCISE CAN ENABLE A RELAPSE. MOREOVER, GEOGRAPHY, ESPECIALLY LIFE IN RURAL AREAS, APPEARS TO HAVE A GREATER CORRELATION WITH ADDICTION RELAPSE.

THE ANNUAL PREVALENCE OF CPT INCREASED THROUGHOUT THE STUDY, REACHING A MAXIMUM OF 14.6%. THE ANNUAL PREVALENCE OF PE INCREASED TO A MAXIMUM OF 5.0% IN 2010, BUT THEN FLATTENED AND DECLINED. ANNUAL UPTAKE OF MINIMALLY ADEQUATE CPT INCREASED A TO MAXIMUM OF 5% IN 2014. ANNUAL UPTAKE OF MINIMALLY ADEQUATE PE INCREASED TO A MAXIMUM OF 1.2% IN 2010. THE CUMULATIVE PREVALENCE OF CPT WAS 19.9% AND CUMULATIVE PREVALENCE FOR PE WAS 7.5%.

REAL-WORLD PROGRAMS TO HELP VETERANS SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITION TO CIVILIAN LIFE MUST BUILD A SENSE OF COMMUNITY, HAVE THE ABILITY TO SCALE, AND BE ABLE TO REACH THE MANY VETERANS WHO CANNOT OR WILL NOT ACCESS CARE. DIGITALLY BASED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVES HAVE EMERGED WITHIN THE PAST FEW YEARS TO IMPROVE THIS ACCESS TO CARE. OUR NOVEL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTERVENTION TEACHES MINDFULNESS-BASED COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY AND NARRATIVE THERAPY USING PEER SUPPORT GROUPS AS GUIDES, WITH HUMAN-FACILITATED ASYNCHRONOUS ONLINE DISCUSSIONS. OUR STUDY APPLIES NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) ANALYTICS TO ASSESS EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR ONLINE INTERVENTION IN ORDER TO TEST WHETHER NLP MAY PROVIDE INSIGHTS AND DETECT NUANCES OF PERSONAL CHANGE AND GROWTH THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY CAPTURED BY SUBJECTIVE SYMPTOM MEASURES. OBJECTIVE: THIS PAPER AIMS TO STUDY THE VALUE OF NLP ANALYTICS IN ASSESSING PROGRESS AND OUTCOMES AMONG COMBAT VETERANS AND MILITARY SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVIVORS PARTICIPATING IN NOVEL ONLINE INTERVENTIONS FOR POSTTRAUMATIC GROWTH. METHODS: IBM WATSON AND LINGUISTIC INQUIRY AND WORD COUNT TOOLS WERE APPLIED TO THE NARRATIVE WRITINGS OF COMBAT VETERANS AND SURVIVORS OF MILITARY SEXUAL TRAUMA WHO PARTICIPATED IN NOVEL ONLINE PEER-SUPPORTED GROUP THERAPIES FOR POSTTRAUMATIC GROWTH. PARTICIPANTS WATCHED VIDEOS, PRACTICED SKILLS SUCH AS MINDFULNESS MEDITATION, TOLD THEIR STORIES THROUGH NARRATIVE WRITING, AND PARTICIPATED IN ASYNCHRONOUS, FACILITATED ONLINE DISCUSSIONS WITH PEERS. THE WRITINGS, INCLUDING ONLINE POSTINGS, BY THE 16 PARTICIPANTS WHO COMPLETED THE PROGRAM WERE ANALYZED AFTER COMPLETION OF THE PROGRAM. RESULTS: OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT NLP CAN PROVIDE VALUABLE INSIGHTS ON SHIFTS IN PERSONALITY TRAITS, PERSONAL VALUES, NEEDS, AND EMOTIONAL TONE IN AN EVALUATION OF OUR NOVEL ONLINE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTERVENTIONS. EMOTIONAL TONE ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN FEAR AND ANXIETY, SADNESS, AND DISGUST, AS WELL AS INCREASES IN JOY. SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS WERE FOUND FOR PERSONAL VALUES AND NEEDS, SUCH AS NEEDING OR DESIRING CLOSENESS AND HELPING OTHERS, AND FOR PERSONALITY TRAITS OF OPENNESS, CONSCIENTIOUSNESS, EXTROVERSION, AGREEABLENESS, AND NEUROTICISM (IE, EMOTIONAL RANGE).

THEREFORE, IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THE INDIVIDUALS, WE HAVE CORRELATED THE LIFESTYLE HABITS IN AN APPROPRIATE PROPORTION TO DETERMINE THE OVERALL IMPACT OF INFLUENCED BEHAVIOR ON THE WELL-BEING OF HUMANS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TO STUDY THE COMBINED IMPACT OF PERSONAL BEHAVIORS, WE HAVE PROPOSED A METHODOLOGY TO DERIVE THE COMPREHENSIVE HEALTHY BEHAVIOR INDEX (HBI) CONSISTING OF TWO MAJOR PROCESSES: (1) BEHAVIORS' WEIGHT-AGE IDENTIFICATION (BWI), AND (2) HEALTHY BEHAVIOR QUANTIFICATION AND INDEX (HBQI) MODELING. THE BWI PROCESS IDENTIFIES THE HIGH RANKED CONTRIBUTING BEHAVIORS THROUGH LIFE-EXPECTANCY BASED WEIGHT-AGE, WHEREAS HBQI DERIVES A MATHEMATICAL MODEL BASED ON QUANTIFICATION AND INDEXING OF BEHAVIOR USING WELLNESS GUIDELINES.

LIFESTYLE DISEASES, CANCERS AND MENTAL DISORDERS HAVE GROWN MOST IN RESEARCH OUTPUT. THE USA WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LARGEST NUMBER OF TOP 10% MOST CITED PUBLICATIONS PER DISEASE GROUP, WITH A GLOBAL SHARE OF 45%. IRAN (+3500%) AND CHINA (+700%) HAVE GROWN MOST IN RESEARCH VOLUME. CONCLUSIONS: THE PROPOSED METHOD PROVIDES A TOOL TO ASSESS BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH OUTPUT IN NEW WAYS. IT CAN BE USED FOR EVALUATION OF HISTORICAL RESEARCH PERFORMANCE, TO SUPPORT DECISION-MAKING IN MANAGEMENT OF RESEARCH PORTFOLIOS, AND TO ALLOCATE RESEARCH FUNDING. FURTHERMORE, USING THIS METHOD TO LINK DISEASE-SPECIFIC RESEARCH OUTPUT TO BURDEN OF DISEASE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE SOCIETAL IMPACT OF BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH.",0,1,0
"379","J I, 2020, ","A SERIOUS OBSTACLE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) METHODS IN THE CLINICAL DOMAIN IS THE ACCESSIBILITY OF TEXTUAL DATA. THE MENTAL HEALTH DOMAIN IS PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING, PARTLY BECAUSE CLINICAL DOCUMENTATION RELIES HEAVILY ON FREE TEXT THAT IS DIFFICULT TO DE-IDENTIFY COMPLETELY. THIS PROBLEM COULD BE TACKLED BY USING ARTIFICIAL MEDICAL DATA. IN THIS WORK, WE PRESENT AN APPROACH TO GENERATE ARTIFICIAL CLINICAL DOCUMENTS. WE APPLY THIS APPROACH TO DISCHARGE SUMMARIES FROM A LARGE MENTAL HEALTHCARE PROVIDER AND DISCHARGE SUMMARIES FROM AN INTENSIVE CARE UNIT. WE PERFORM AN EXTENSIVE INTRINSIC EVALUATION WHERE WE (1) APPLY SEVERAL MEASURES OF TEXT PRESERVATION; (2) MEASURE HOW MUCH THE MODEL MEMORISES TRAINING DATA; AND (3) ESTIMATE CLINICAL VALIDITY OF THE GENERATED TEXT BASED ON A HUMAN EVALUATION TASK. FURTHERMORE, WE PERFORM AN EXTRINSIC EVALUATION BY STUDYING THE IMPACT OF USING ARTIFICIAL TEXT IN A DOWNSTREAM NLP TEXT CLASSIFICATION TASK. WE FOUND THAT USING THIS ARTIFICIAL DATA AS TRAINING DATA CAN LEAD TO CLASSIFICATION RESULTS THAT ARE COMPARABLE TO THE ORIGINAL RESULTS. ADDITIONALLY, USING ONLY A SMALL AMOUNT OF INFORMATION FROM THE ORIGINAL DATA TO CONDITION THE GENERATION OF THE ARTIFICIAL DATA IS SUCCESSFUL, WHICH HOLDS PROMISE FOR REDUCING THE RISK OF THESE ARTIFICIAL DATA RETAINING RARE INFORMATION FROM THE ORIGINAL DATA. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FINDING FOR OUR LONG-TERM GOAL OF BEING ABLE TO GENERATE ARTIFICIAL CLINICAL DATA THAT CAN BE RELEASED TO THE WIDER RESEARCH COMMUNITY AND ACCELERATE ADVANCES IN DEVELOPING COMPUTATIONAL METHODS THAT USE HEALTHCARE DATA.",1,1,0

OBJECTIVE: OUR PURPOSE WAS TO IDENTIFY THE CONTENT AND FREQUENCY OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT MENTHOL CIGARETTES, INCLUDING THEMES, POPULATIONS, USER SMOKING STATUS, OTHER TOBACCO OR SUBSTANCES, TWEET CHARACTERISTICS, AND SENTIMENT. WE ALSO EXAMINED DIFFERENCES IN MENTHOL CIGARETTE SENTIMENT BY PREVALENT CATEGORIES, WHICH ALLOWED US TO ASSESS POTENTIAL PERCEPTIONS, MISPERCEPTIONS, AND SOCIAL NORMS ABOUT MENTHOL CIGARETTES ON TWITTER. THIS APPROACH CAN INFORM COMMUNICATION ABOUT THESE PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY TO SUBGROUPS WHO ARE AT RISK FOR MENTHOL CIGARETTE USE. METHODS: THROUGH A COMBINATION OF HUMAN AND MACHINE CLASSIFICATION, WE IDENTIFIED 94,627 MENTHOL CIGARETTE-RELEVANT TWEETS FROM FEBRUARY 1, 2012 TO JANUARY 31, 2013 (1 YEAR) FROM OVER 47 MILLION TOBACCO-RELATED MESSAGES GATHERED PROSPECTIVELY FROM THE TWITTER FIREHOSE OF ALL PUBLIC TWEETS AND METADATA. THEN, 4 HUMAN CODERS EVALUATED A RANDOM SAMPLE OF 7000 TWEETS FOR CATEGORIES, INCLUDING SENTIMENT TOWARD MENTHOL CIGARETTES. RESULTS: WE FOUND THAT 47.98% (3194/6657) OF TWEETS EXPRESSED POSITIVE SENTIMENT, WHILE 40.26% (2680/6657) WERE NEGATIVE TOWARD MENTHOL CIGARETTES. THE MAJORITY OF TWEETS BY LIKELY SMOKERS (2653/4038, 65.70%) EXPRESSED POSITIVE SENTIMENT, WHILE 91.2% (320/351) OF NONSMOKERS AND 71.7% (91/127) OF FORMER SMOKERS INDICATED NEGATIVE VIEWS. POSITIVE VIEWS TOWARD MENTHOL CIGARETTES WERE PREDOMINANT IN TWEETS THAT DISCUSSED ADDICTION OR CRAVING, MARIJUANA, SMOKING, TASTE OR SENSATION, SONG LYRICS, AND TOBACCO INDUSTRY OR MARKETING OR TWEETS THAT WERE COMMERCIAL IN NATURE. NEGATIVE VIEWS TOWARD MENTHOL WERE MORE COMMON IN TWEETS ABOUT SMOKING CESSATION, HEALTH, AFRICAN AMERICANS, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS-LARGELY DUE TO EXPRESSION OF NEGATIVE STEREOTYPES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE GROUPS' USE OF MENTHOL CIGARETTES. CONCLUSIONS: EXAMINATIONS OF PUBLIC OPINIONS TOWARD MENTHOL CIGARETTES THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA CAN HELP TO INFORM THE FRAMING OF PUBLIC COMMUNICATION ABOUT MENTHOL CIGARETTES, PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF POTENTIAL REGULATION BY THE EUROPEAN UNION, US FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, OTHER JURISDICTIONS, AND LOCALITIES.",1,1,0

METHODS: A VALIDATED FRAMEWORK OF AI TECHNIQUES AND NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) METHODS, WAS USED TO INVESTIGATE PCA PATIENT ACTIVITIES BASED ON CONVERSATIONS IN TEN INTERNATIONAL OCSG (18,496 PATIENTS- 277,805 CONVERSATIONS). THE SPECIFIC FOCUS WAS ON ACTIVITIES THAT INDICATE PSYCHOLOGICAL MORBIDITY; THE REASONS FOR JOINING OCSG, DEEP EMOTIONS AND THE VARIATION FROM JOINING THROUGH TO MILESTONES IN THE CANCER TRAJECTORY. COMPARATIVE ANALYSES WERE CONDUCTED USING T-TESTS, ONE-WAY ANOVA AND TUKEY-KRAMER POST-HOC ANALYSIS. FINDINGS: PCA PATIENTS JOINED OCSG AT FOUR KEY PHASES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS; DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT, SIDE-EFFECTS, AND RECURRENCE, THE MAJORITY GROUP WAS 'TREATMENT' (61.72%). THE FOUR GROUPS VARIED IN EXPRESSION OF THE INTENSE EMOTIONAL BURDEN OF CANCER.

IN ADDITION TO CONSTRUCTING VARIABLES FROM ADMINISTRATIVE DATA, VARIABLES WERE ABSTRACTED FROM ELECTRONIC MEDICAL CHART NOTES IN THE YEAR PRIOR TO THE INDEX DATE IN 5 CATEGORIES: CLINICAL SYMPTOMS AND DIAGNOSES, SUBSTANCE USE, LIFE STRESSORS, BEHAVIORAL/IDEATION MEASURES (EG, SUICIDE ATTEMPTS), AND TREATMENTS RECEIVED. LOGISTIC REGRESSION WAS USED TO ASSESS THE ASSOCIATIONS. RESULTS: EVEN AFTER WE ADJUSTED FOR ADMINISTRATIVELY AVAILABLE DATA, SUICIDAL BEHAVIORS AND SUBSTANCE-RELATED VARIABLES WERE THE STRONGEST INDEPENDENT PREDICTORS OF SUICIDE. PRESCRIPTION DRUG MISUSE HAD AN ODDS RATIO (OR) OF 6.8 (95% CI, 2.5-18.5); HISTORY OF SUICIDE ATTEMPTS, 6.6 (95% CI, 1.7-26.4); AND ALCOHOL ABUSE/DEPENDENCE, 3.3 (95% CI, 1.9-5.7). DIFFICULTY WITH ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE WAS A PREDICTOR OF SUICIDE (OR = 2.9; 95% CI, 1.3-6.3). RECEIPT OF VHA SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT WAS PROTECTIVE (OR = 0.4; 95% CI, 0.1-0.9). CONCLUSIONS: PRESCRIPTION DRUG AND ALCOHOL MISUSE ASSESSMENTS SHOULD BE PRIORITIZED IN SUICIDE ASSESSMENTS AMONG DEPRESSED PATIENTS.

OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO REPORT ON THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN DEPRESSION SEVERITY AND THE VARIABILITY (TIME-UNSTRUCTURED) AND INSTABILITY (TIME-STRUCTURED) IN EMOTION WORD EXPRESSION ON FACEBOOK AND TWITTER ACROSS STATUS UPDATES. METHODS: STATUS UPDATES AND DEPRESSION SEVERITY RATINGS OF 29 FACEBOOK USERS AND 49 TWITTER USERS WERE COLLECTED THROUGH THE APP MOODPRISM. THE AVERAGE PROPORTION OF POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EMOTION WORDS USED, WITHIN-PERSON VARIABILITY, AND INSTABILITY WERE COMPUTED. RESULTS: NEGATIVE EMOTION WORD INSTABILITY WAS A SIGNIFICANT PREDICTOR OF GREATER DEPRESSION SEVERITY ON FACEBOOK (R(S)(29)=.44, P=.02, 95% CI 0.09-0.69), EVEN AFTER CONTROLLING FOR THE AVERAGE PROPORTION OF NEGATIVE EMOTION WORDS USED (PARTIAL R(S)(26)=.51, P=.006) AND WITHIN-PERSON VARIABILITY (PARTIAL R(S)(26)=.49, P=.009).

DESIGN: OBSERVATIONAL STUDY WITH EXPLORATORY MEDIATION ANALYSIS. SETTING: ANONYMISED ELECTRONIC MENTAL HEALTH RECORD DATA FROM THE SOUTH LONDON AND MAUDSLEY NHS FOUNDATION TRUST. PARTICIPANTS: 2026 PEOPLE PRESENTING TO EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES WITH FEP. EXPOSURE: CANNABIS USE AT PRESENTATION, IDENTIFIED USING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ADMISSION TO PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL AND CLOZAPINE PRESCRIPTION UP TO 5 YEARS FOLLOWING PRESENTATION. MEDIATOR: NUMBER OF UNIQUE ANTIPSYCHOTICS PRESCRIBED. RESULTS: CANNABIS USE WAS PRESENT IN 46.3% OF THE SAMPLE AT FIRST PRESENTATION AND WAS PARTICULARLY COMMON IN PATIENTS WHO WERE 16-25, MALE AND SINGLE.

GENOMEWIDE GENOTYPE DATA FOR 3330 BD CASES AND 3952 CONTROLS OF EUROPEAN ANCESTRY WERE USED TO ESTIMATE SNP-BASED HERITABILITY (H(2)(G)) AND GENETIC CORRELATION (R(G)) BETWEEN EHR-BASED PHENOTYPE DEFINITIONS AND TRADITIONALLY ASCERTAINED BD CASES IN GWAS BY THE ICCBD AND PSYCHIATRIC GENOMICS CONSORTIUM (PGC) USING LD SCORE REGRESSION. WE EVALUATED BD CASES IDENTIFIED USING 4 EHR-BASED ALGORITHMS: AN NLP-BASED ALGORITHM (95-NLP) AND THREE RULE-BASED ALGORITHMS USING CODIFIED EHR WITH DECREASING LEVELS OF STRINGENCY-""CODED-STRICT"", ""CODED-BROAD"", AND ""CODED-BROAD BASED ON A SINGLE CLINICAL ENCOUNTER"" (CODED-BROAD-SV). THE ANALYTIC SAMPLE COMPRISED 862 95-NLP, 1968 CODED-STRICT, 2581 CODED-BROAD, 408 CODED-BROAD-SV BD CASES, AND 3 952 CONTROLS. THE ESTIMATED H(2)(G) WERE 0.24 (P = 0.015), 0.09 (P = 0.064), 0.13 (P = 0.003), 0.00 (P = 0.591) FOR 95-NLP, CODED-STRICT, CODED-BROAD AND CODED-BROAD-SV BD, RESPECTIVELY. THE H(2)(G) FOR ALL EHR-BASED CASES COMBINED EXCEPT CODED-BROAD-SV (EXCLUDED DUE TO 0 H(2)(G)) WAS 0.12 (P = 0.004). THESE H(2)(G) WERE LOWER OR SIMILAR TO THE H(2)(G) OBSERVED BY THE ICCBD + PGCBD (0.23, P = 3.17E-80, TOTAL N = 33,181). HOWEVER, THE R(G) BETWEEN ICCBD + PGCBD AND THE EHR-BASED CASES WERE HIGH FOR 95-NLP (0.66, P = 3.69 10(-5)), CODED-STRICT (1.00, P = 2.40 10(-4)), AND CODED-BROAD (0.74, P = 8.11 10(-7)). THE R(G) BETWEEN EHR-BASED BD DEFINITIONS RANGED FROM 0.90 TO 0.98. THESE RESULTS PROVIDE THE FIRST GENETIC VALIDATION OF AUTOMATED EHR-BASED PHENOTYPING FOR BD AND SUGGEST THAT THIS APPROACH IDENTIFIES CASES THAT ARE HIGHLY GENETICALLY CORRELATED WITH THOSE ASCERTAINED THROUGH CONVENTIONAL METHODS. HIGH THROUGHPUT PHENOTYPING USING THE LARGE DATA RESOURCES AVAILABLE IN EHRS REPRESENTS A VIABLE METHOD FOR ACCELERATING PSYCHIATRIC GENETIC RESEARCH.",0,1,0
"466","N B, 2017, ","BACKGROUND: USE OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITE TWITTER IS HIGHLY PREVALENT AND HAS LED TO A PLETHORA OF WEB-BASED SOCIAL AND HEALTH-RELATED DATA AVAILABLE FOR USE BY RESEARCHERS. AS SUCH, RESEARCHERS ARE INCREASINGLY USING DATA FROM SOCIAL MEDIA TO RETRIEVE AND ANALYZE MENTAL HEALTH-RELATED CONTENT. HOWEVER, THERE IS LIMITED EVIDENCE REGARDING WHY PEOPLE USE THIS EMERGING PLATFORM TO DISCUSS MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS IN THE FIRST PLACE. OBJECTIVES: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXPLORE THE REASONS WHY INDIVIDUALS DISCUSS MENTAL HEALTH ON THE SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITE TWITTER. THE STUDY WAS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND TO IMPLEMENT A STUDY-SPECIFIC HASHTAG FOR RESEARCH; THEREFORE, WE ALSO EXAMINED HOW FEASIBLE IT WAS TO CIRCULATE AND ANALYZE A STUDY-SPECIFIC HASHTAG FOR MENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH. METHODS: TEXT MINING METHODS USING THE TWITTER STREAMING APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE (API) AND TWITTER SEARCH API WERE USED TO COLLECT AND ORGANIZE TWEETS FROM THE HASHTAG #WHYWETWEETMH, CIRCULATED BETWEEN SEPTEMBER 2015 AND NOVEMBER 2015. TWEETS WERE ANALYZED THEMATICALLY TO UNDERSTAND THE KEY REASONS FOR DISCUSSING MENTAL HEALTH USING THE TWITTER PLATFORM. RESULTS: FOUR OVERARCHING THEMES WERE DERIVED FROM THE 132 TWEETS COLLECTED: (1) SENSE OF COMMUNITY; (2) RAISING AWARENESS AND COMBATTING STIGMA; (3) SAFE SPACE FOR EXPRESSION; AND (4) COPING AND EMPOWERMENT. IN ADDITION, 11 ASSOCIATED SUBTHEMES WERE ALSO IDENTIFIED. CONCLUSIONS: THE THEMES DERIVED FROM THE CONTENT OF THE TWEETS HIGHLIGHT THE PERCEIVED THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS OF TWITTER THROUGH THE PROVISION OF SUPPORT AND INFORMATION AND THE POTENTIAL FOR SELF-MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES. THE ABILITY TO USE TWITTER TO COMBAT STIGMA AND RAISE AWARENESS OF MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS INDICATES THE SOCIETAL BENEFITS THAT CAN BE FACILITATED VIA THE PLATFORM. THE NUMBER OF TWEETS AND THEMES IDENTIFIED DEMONSTRATES THE FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING STUDY-SPECIFIC HASHTAGS TO EXPLORE RESEARCH QUESTIONS IN THE FIELD OF MENTAL HEALTH AND CAN BE USED AS A BASIS FOR OTHER HEALTH-RELATED RESEARCH.",1,1,1
"467","JL W, 2012, ","BACKGROUND: ONLINE PSYCHIATRIC TEXTS ARE NATURAL LANGUAGE TEXTS EXPRESSING DEPRESSIVE PROBLEMS, PUBLISHED BY INTERNET USERS VIA COMMUNITY-BASED WEB SERVICES SUCH AS WEB FORUMS, MESSAGE BOARDS AND BLOGS. UNDERSTANDING THE CAUSE-EFFECT RELATIONS EMBEDDED IN THESE PSYCHIATRIC TEXTS CAN PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO THE AUTHORS' PROBLEMS, THUS INCREASING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ONLINE PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES. METHODS: PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE PROPOSED THE USE OF WORD PAIRS EXTRACTED FROM A SET OF SENTENCE PAIRS TO IDENTIFY CAUSE-EFFECT RELATIONS BETWEEN SENTENCES. A WORD PAIR IS MADE UP OF TWO WORDS, WITH ONE COMING FROM THE CAUSE TEXT SPAN AND THE OTHER FROM THE EFFECT TEXT SPAN. ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE WORDS CAN BE USED TO CAPTURE INDIVIDUAL WORD ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN CAUSE AND EFFECT SENTENCES. FOR INSTANCE, (BROKE UP, LIFE) AND (BOYFRIEND, MEANINGLESS) ARE TWO WORD PAIRS EXTRACTED FROM THE SENTENCE PAIR: ""I BROKE UP WITH MY BOYFRIEND. LIFE IS NOW MEANINGLESS TO ME"". THE MAJOR LIMITATION OF WORD PAIRS IS THAT INDIVIDUAL WORDS IN SENTENCES USUALLY CANNOT REFLECT THE EXACT MEANING OF THE CAUSE AND EFFECT EVENTS, AND THUS MAY PRODUCE SEMANTICALLY INCOMPLETE WORD PAIRS, AS THE PREVIOUS EXAMPLES SHOW. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY PROPOSES THE USE OF INTER-SENTENTIAL LANGUAGE PATTERNS SUCH AS BROKE UP, BOYFRIEND>, <LIFE, MEANINGLESS TO DETECT CAUSALITY BETWEEN SENTENCES. THE INTER-SENTENTIAL LANGUAGE PATTERNS CAN CAPTURE ASSOCIATIONS AMONG MULTIPLE WORDS WITHIN AND BETWEEN SENTENCES, THUS CAN PROVIDE MORE PRECISE INFORMATION THAN WORD PAIRS. TO ACQUIRE INTER-SENTENTIAL LANGUAGE PATTERNS, WE DEVELOP A TEXT MINING FRAMEWORK BY EXTENDING THE CLASSICAL ASSOCIATION RULE MINING ALGORITHM SUCH THAT IT CAN DISCOVER FREQUENTLY CO-OCCURRING PATTERNS ACROSS THE SENTENCE BOUNDARY. RESULTS: PERFORMANCE WAS EVALUATED ON A CORPUS OF TEXTS COLLECTED FROM PSYCHPARK (HTTP://WWW.PSYCHPARK.ORG), A VIRTUAL PSYCHIATRIC CLINIC MAINTAINED BY A GROUP OF VOLUNTEER PROFESSIONALS FROM THE TAIWAN ASSOCIATION OF MENTAL HEALTH INFORMATICS. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT THE USE OF INTER-SENTENTIAL LANGUAGE PATTERNS OUTPERFORMED THE USE OF WORD PAIRS PROPOSED IN PREVIOUS STUDIES. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THE ACQUISITION OF INTER-SENTENTIAL LANGUAGE PATTERNS FOR CAUSALITY DETECTION FROM ONLINE PSYCHIATRIC TEXTS. SUCH SEMANTICALLY MORE COMPLETE AND PRECISE FEATURES CAN IMPROVE CAUSALITY DETECTION PERFORMANCE.",0,1,0
"468","A L, 2019, -a","BACKGROUND: MENTAL DISORDERS HAVE BECOME A MAJOR CONCERN IN PUBLIC HEALTH, AND THEY ARE ONE OF THE MAIN CAUSES OF THE OVERALL DISEASE BURDEN WORLDWIDE. SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS ALLOW US TO OBSERVE THE ACTIVITIES, THOUGHTS, AND FEELINGS OF PEOPLE'S DAILY LIVES, INCLUDING THOSE OF PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM MENTAL DISORDERS. THERE ARE STUDIES THAT HAVE ANALYZED THE INFLUENCE OF MENTAL DISORDERS, INCLUDING DEPRESSION, IN THE BEHAVIOR OF SOCIAL MEDIA USERS, BUT THEY HAVE BEEN USUALLY FOCUSED ON MESSAGES WRITTEN IN ENGLISH. OBJECTIVE: THE STUDY AIMED TO IDENTIFY THE LINGUISTIC FEATURES OF TWEETS IN SPANISH AND THE BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS OF TWITTER USERS WHO GENERATE THEM, WHICH COULD SUGGEST SIGNS OF DEPRESSION. METHODS: THIS STUDY WAS DEVELOPED IN 2 STEPS. IN THE FIRST STEP, THE SELECTION OF USERS AND THE COMPILATION OF TWEETS WERE PERFORMED. A TOTAL OF 3 DATASETS OF TWEETS WERE CREATED, A DEPRESSIVE USERS DATASET (MADE UP OF THE TIMELINE OF 90 USERS WHO EXPLICITLY MENTIONED THAT THEY SUFFER FROM DEPRESSION), A DEPRESSIVE TWEETS DATASET (A MANUAL SELECTION OF TWEETS FROM THE PREVIOUS USERS, WHICH INCLUDED EXPRESSIONS INDICATIVE OF DEPRESSION), AND A CONTROL DATASET (MADE UP OF THE TIMELINE OF 450 RANDOMLY SELECTED USERS). IN THE SECOND STEP, THE COMPARISON AND ANALYSIS OF THE 3 DATASETS OF TWEETS WERE CARRIED OUT. RESULTS: IN COMPARISON WITH THE CONTROL DATASET, THE DEPRESSIVE USERS ARE LESS ACTIVE IN POSTING TWEETS, DOING IT MORE FREQUENTLY BETWEEN 23:00 AND 6:00 (P<.001). THE PERCENTAGE OF NOUNS USED BY THE CONTROL DATASET ALMOST DOUBLES THAT OF THE DEPRESSIVE USERS (P<.001). BY CONTRAST, THE USE OF VERBS IS MORE COMMON IN THE DEPRESSIVE USERS DATASET (P<.001). THE FIRST-PERSON SINGULAR PRONOUN WAS BY FAR THE MOST USED IN THE DEPRESSIVE USERS DATASET (80%), AND THE FIRST- AND THE SECOND-PERSON PLURAL PRONOUNS WERE THE LEAST FREQUENT (0.4% IN BOTH CASES), THIS DISTRIBUTION BEING DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE CONTROL DATASET (P<.001). EMOTIONS RELATED TO SADNESS, ANGER, AND DISGUST WERE MORE COMMON IN THE DEPRESSIVE USERS AND DEPRESSIVE TWEETS DATASETS, WITH SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WHEN COMPARING THESE DATASETS WITH THE CONTROL DATASET (P<.001). AS FOR NEGATION WORDS, THEY WERE DETECTED IN 34% AND 46% OF TWEETS IN AMONG DEPRESSIVE USERS AND IN DEPRESSIVE TWEETS, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE CONTROL DATASET (P<.001). NEGATIVE POLARITY WAS MORE FREQUENT IN THE DEPRESSIVE USERS (54%) AND DEPRESSIVE TWEETS (65%) DATASETS THAN IN THE CONTROL DATASET (43.5%; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: TWITTER USERS WHO ARE POTENTIALLY SUFFERING FROM DEPRESSION MODIFY THE GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THEIR LANGUAGE AND THE WAY THEY INTERACT ON SOCIAL MEDIA.

THIS STUDY EMPLOYS TEXT MINING, QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS, AND VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUES TO COMPARE DISCUSSION TOPICS IN PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE ONLINE MENTAL HEALTH COMMUNITIES FOR THREE CONDITIONS: ANXIETY, DEPRESSION AND POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER. METHODS: FIRST, ONLINE DISCUSSION CONTENT FOR THE THREE CONDITIONS WAS COLLECTED FROM THREE REDDIT COMMUNITIES (R/ANXIETY, R/DEPRESSION, AND R/PTSD). SECOND, CONTENT WAS PRE-PROCESSED, AND THEN CLUSTERED USING THE K-MEANS ALGORITHM TO IDENTIFY THEMES THAT WERE COMMONLY DISCUSSED BY MEMBERS. THIRD, WE QUALITATIVELY EXAMINED THE COMMON THEMES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THEM, AS WELL AS THEIR SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES. FOURTH, WE EMPLOYED MULTIPLE VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUES TO FORM A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE IDENTIFIED THEMES FOR THE THREE MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. RESULTS: THE THREE MENTAL HEALTH COMMUNITIES SHARED FOUR THEMES: SHARING OF POSITIVE EMOTION, GRATITUDE FOR RECEIVING EMOTIONAL SUPPORT, AND SLEEP- AND WORK-RELATED ISSUES. DEPRESSION CLUSTERS TENDED TO FOCUS ON SELF-EXPRESSED CONTEXTUAL ASPECTS OF DEPRESSION, WHEREAS THE ANXIETY DISORDERS AND POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER CLUSTERS ADDRESSED MORE TREATMENT- AND MEDICATION-RELATED ISSUES. VISUALIZATIONS SHOWED THAT DISCUSSION TOPICS FROM THE ANXIETY DISORDERS AND POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER SUBREDDITS SHARED MORE SIMILARITIES TO ONE ANOTHER THAN TO THE DEPRESSION SUBREDDIT. CONCLUSIONS: WE OBSERVED THAT THE MEMBERS OF THE THREE COMMUNITIES SHARED SEVERAL OVERLAPPING CONCERNS (I.E., SLEEP- AND WORK-RELATED PROBLEMS) AND DISCUSSION PATTERNS (I.E., SHARING OF POSITIVE EMOTION AND SHOWING GRATITUDE FOR RECEIVING EMOTIONAL SUPPORT). WE ALSO HIGHLIGHTED THAT THE DISCUSSIONS FROM THE R/ANXIETY AND R/PTSD COMMUNITIES WERE MORE SIMILAR TO ONE ANOTHER THAN TO DISCUSSIONS FROM THE R/DEPRESSION COMMUNITY.

THUS, MONITORING THE MOOD OF THE PATIENTS IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THEIR TREATMENT. MANY CANCER PATIENTS ARE USERS OF ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKS AND MANY OF THEM TAKE PART IN CANCER VIRTUAL COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY EXCHANGE MESSAGES COMMENTING ABOUT THEIR TREATMENT OR GIVING SUPPORT TO OTHER PATIENTS IN THE COMMUNITY. MOST OF THESE COMMUNITIES ARE OF PUBLIC ACCESS AND THUS ARE USEFUL SOURCES OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE MOOD OF PATIENTS. BASED ON THAT, SENTIMENT ANALYSIS METHODS CAN BE USEFUL TO AUTOMATICALLY DETECT POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE MOOD OF CANCER PATIENTS BY ANALYZING THEIR MESSAGES IN THESE ONLINE COMMUNITIES. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK IS TO PRESENT A SENTIMENT ANALYSIS TOOL, NAMED SENTIHEALTH-CANCER (SHC-PT), THAT IMPROVES THE DETECTION OF EMOTIONAL STATE OF PATIENTS IN BRAZILIAN ONLINE CANCER COMMUNITIES, BY INSPECTING THEIR POSTS WRITTEN IN PORTUGUESE LANGUAGE. THE SHC-PT IS A SENTIMENT ANALYSIS TOOL WHICH IS TAILORED SPECIFICALLY TO DETECT POSITIVE, NEGATIVE OR NEUTRAL MESSAGES OF PATIENTS IN ONLINE COMMUNITIES OF CANCER PATIENTS. WE CONDUCTED A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE PROPOSED METHOD WITH A SET OF GENERAL-PURPOSE SENTIMENT ANALYSIS TOOLS ADAPTED TO THIS CONTEXT. METHODS: DIFFERENT COLLECTIONS OF POSTS WERE OBTAINED FROM TWO CANCER COMMUNITIES IN FACEBOOK. ADDITIONALLY, THE POSTS WERE ANALYZED BY SENTIMENT ANALYSIS TOOLS THAT SUPPORT THE PORTUGUESE LANGUAGE (SEMANTRIA AND SENTISTRENGTH) AND BY THE TOOL SHC-PT, DEVELOPED BASED ON THE METHOD PROPOSED IN THIS PAPER CALLED SENTIHEALTH. MOREOVER, AS A SECOND ALTERNATIVE TO ANALYZE THE TEXTS IN PORTUGUESE, THE COLLECTED TEXTS WERE AUTOMATICALLY TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH, AND SUBMITTED TO SENTIMENT ANALYSIS TOOLS THAT DO NOT SUPPORT THE PORTUGUESE LANGUAGE (ALCHEMYAPI AND TEXTALYTICS) AND ALSO TO SEMANTRIA AND SENTISTRENGTH, USING THE ENGLISH OPTION OF THESE TOOLS. SIX EXPERIMENTS WERE CONDUCTED WITH SOME VARIATIONS AND DIFFERENT ORIGINS OF THE COLLECTED POSTS. THE RESULTS WERE MEASURED USING THE FOLLOWING METRICS: PRECISION, RECALL, F1-MEASURE AND ACCURACY RESULTS: THE PROPOSED TOOL SHC-PT REACHED THE BEST AVERAGES FOR ACCURACY AND F1-MEASURE (HARMONIC MEAN BETWEEN RECALL AND PRECISION) IN THE THREE SENTIMENT CLASSES ADDRESSED (POSITIVE, NEGATIVE AND NEUTRAL) IN ALL EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS. MOREOVER, THE WORST ACCURACY VALUE (58%) ACHIEVED BY SHC-PT IN ANY EXPERIMENT IS 11.53% BETTER THAN THE GREATEST ACCURACY (52%) PRESENTED BY OTHER ADDRESSED TOOLS. FINALLY, THE WORST AVERAGE F1 (48.46%) REACHED BY SHC-PT IN ANY EXPERIMENT IS 4.14% BETTER THAN THE GREATEST AVERAGE F1 (46.53%) ACHIEVED BY OTHER ADDRESSED TOOLS.

"506","E B, 2015, ","BACKGROUND: THE MOST IMPORTANT AND CONTESTED ELEMENT OF NURSING IDENTITY MAY BE THE PATIENT-CENTREDNESS OF NURSING, THOUGH THIS CONCEPT IS NOT WELL-TREATED IN THE NURSING IDENTITY LITERATURE. MORE CONCEPTUALLY-BASED MAPPING OF NURSING IDENTITY CONSTRUCTS ARE NEEDED TO HELP NURSES SHAPE THEIR IDENTITY. THE FIELD OF COMPUTATIONAL TEXT ANALYTICS OFFERS NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO SCRUTINISE HOW GROWING DISCIPLINES SUCH AS HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH CONSTRUCT NURSING IDENTITY. THIS PAPER MAPS THE CONCEPTUAL CONTENT OF SCHOLARLY HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH IN PUBMED AS IT RELATES TO THE PATIENT-CENTEREDNESS OF NURSING. METHODS: COMPUTATIONAL TEXT ANALYTICS SOFTWARE WAS USED TO ANALYSE ALL HEALTH SERVICES ABSTRACTS IN THE DATABASE PUBMED SINCE 1986. ABSTRACTS WERE TREATED AS INDICATIVE OF THE CONTENT OF HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH. THE DATABASE PUBMED WAS SEARCHED FOR ALL RESEARCH PAPERS USING THE TERM ""SERVICE"" OR ""SERVICES"" IN THE ABSTRACT OR KEYWORDS FOR THE PERIOD 01/01/1986 TO 30/06/2013. A TOTAL OF 234,926 ABSTRACTS WERE OBTAINED. LEXIMANCER SOFTWARE WAS USED IN 1) MAPPING OF 4,144,458 INSTANCES OF 107 CONCEPTS; 2) ANALYSIS OF 106 PAIRED CONCEPT CO-OCCURRENCES FOR THE NURSING CONCEPT; AND 3) SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF THE NURSING CONCEPT VERSUS PATIENT, FAMILY AND COMMUNITY CONCEPTS, AND CLINICAL CONCEPTS. RESULTS: NURSING IS CONSTRUCTED WITHIN QUALITY ASSURANCE OR SERVICE IMPLEMENTATION OR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT CONCEPTS. IT IS RELATIVELY DISCONNECTED FROM PATIENT, FAMILY OR COMMUNITY CARE CONCEPTS. CONCLUSIONS: FOR THOSE WHO AGREE THAT PATIENT-CENTREDNESS SHOULD BE A PART OF NURSING IDENTITY IN PRACTICE, THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR DEVELOPMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH INTO BOTH THE NATURE OF THE CARING CONSTRUCT IN NURSING IDENTITY AND ITS EXPRESSION IN PRACTICE. MORE FUNDAMENTALLY, THE STUDY RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH CULTURES EVEN VALUE THE POLITICALLY POPULAR IDEA OF NURSES AS PATIENT-CENTRED CAREGIVERS AND WHETHER THEY SHOULD.",1,1,0

THE INCREASING PUBLIC AWARENESS OF AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS (ASD) LEADS MORE PARENTS TO SUSPECT ASD IN THEIR CHILD. EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF ASD IS IMPORTANT FOR EARLY INTERVENTION. OBJECTIVE: TO CHARACTERIZE THE SYMPTOMS MENTIONED IN ONLINE QUERIES POSED BY PARENTS WHO SUSPECT THAT THEIR CHILD MIGHT HAVE ASD AND DETERMINE WHETHER THEY ARE AGE-SPECIFIC. TO TEST THE EFFICACY OF MACHINE LEARNING TOOLS IN CLASSIFYING THE CHILD'S RISK OF ASD BASED ON THE PARENT'S NARRATIVE. METHODS: TO THIS END, WE ANALYZED ONLINE QUERIES POSED BY PARENTS WHO WERE CONCERNED THAT THEIR CHILD MIGHT HAVE ASD AND CATEGORIZED THE WARNING SIGNS THEY MENTIONED ACCORDING TO ASD-SPECIFIC AND NON-ASD-SPECIFIC DOMAINS. WE THEN USED THE DATA TO TEST THE EFFICACY WITH WHICH A TRAINED MACHINE LEARNING TOOL CLASSIFIED THE DEGREE OF ASD RISK. YAHOO ANSWERS, A SOCIAL SITE FOR POSTING QUERIES AND FINDING ANSWERS, WAS MINED FOR QUERIES OF PARENTS ASKING THE COMMUNITY WHETHER THEIR CHILD HAS ASD. A TOTAL OF 195 QUERIES WERE SAMPLED FOR THIS STUDY (MEAN CHILD AGE=38.0 MONTHS; 84.7% [160/189] BOYS). CONTENT TEXT ANALYSIS OF THE QUERIES AIMED TO CATEGORIZE THE TYPES OF SYMPTOMS DESCRIBED AND OBTAIN CLINICAL JUDGMENT OF THE CHILD'S ASD-RISK LEVEL. RESULTS: CONCERNS RELATED TO REPETITIVE AND RESTRICTED BEHAVIORS AND INTERESTS (RRBI) WERE THE MOST PREVALENT (75.4%, 147/195), FOLLOWED BY CONCERNS RELATED TO LANGUAGE (61.5%, 120/195) AND EMOTIONAL MARKERS (50.3%, 98/195). OF THE 195 QUERIES, 18.5% (36/195) WERE RATED BY CLINICAL EXPERTS AS LOW-RISK, 30.8% (60/195) AS MEDIUM-RISK, AND 50.8% (99/195) AS HIGH-RISK.

HOWEVER, PURE TEXT DATA REQUIRES SUBSTANTIAL HUMAN RESOURCES AND TIME TO EXTRACT AND APPLY THE KNOWLEDGE, RESULTING IN MANY DETAILS NOT BEING DISCOVERED AND USED. THIS STUDY PROPOSES A NOVEL APPROACH THAT EXPLORES A TEXT MINING FLOW TO CAPTURE THE BEHAVIOR OF SMOKERS QUITTING TOBACCO FROM THEIR FREE-TEXT MEDICAL RECORDS. MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE PAPER EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF THESE CHANGES ON SMOKERS. THE GOAL IS TO HELP SMOKERS QUIT SMOKING. THE STUDY POPULATION INCLUDED ADULT PATIENTS THAT WERE >20 YEARS OLD OF AGE WHO CONSULTED THE MEDICAL CENTER'S SMOKING CESSATION OUTPATIENT CLINIC FROM JANUARY TO DECEMBER 2016. A TOTAL OF 246 PATIENTS VISITED THE CLINIC IN THE STUDY PERIOD. AFTER EXCLUDING INCOMPLETE MEDICAL RECORDS OR LOST FOLLOW UP, THERE WERE 141 PATIENTS INCLUDED IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS. THERE ARE 141 VALID DATA POINTS FOR PATIENTS WHO ONLY TREATED ONCE AND PATIENTS WITH EMPTY MEDICAL RECORDS. TWO INDEPENDENT REVIEW AUTHORS WILL MAKE THE STUDY SELECTION BASED ON THE STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA. OUR PARTICIPANTS ARE FROM ALL THE PATIENTS THAT WERE INVOLVED IN THIS STUDY AND THE STAFF OF DIVISION OF FAMILY MEDICINE, NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL. INTERVENTIONS AND STUDY APPRAISAL ARE NOT REQUIRED. METHODS: THE PAPER DEVELOPS AN ALGORITHM FOR ANALYZING SMOKING CESSATION TREATMENT PLANS DOCUMENTED IN FREE-TEXT MEDICAL RECORDS. THE APPROACH INVOLVES THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INFORMATION EXTRACTION FLOW THAT USES A COMBINATION OF DATA MINING TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING TEXT MINING. IT CAN USE NOT ONLY TO HELP OTHERS QUIT SMOKING BUT ALSO FOR OTHER MEDICAL RECORDS WITH SIMILAR DATA ELEMENTS. THE APRIORI ASSOCIATIONS OF OUR ALGORITHM FROM THE TEXT MINING REVEALED SEVERAL IMPORTANT CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR PHYSICIANS DURING SMOKING CESSATION. FOR EXAMPLE, AN APPARENT ASSOCIATION BETWEEN NICOTINE REPLACEMENT THERAPY (NRT) AND OTHER MEDICATIONS SUCH AS INDERAL, RIVOTRIL, DOGMATYL, AND SOLAXIN. INDERAL AND RIVOTRIL USE IN PATIENTS WITH ANXIETY DISORDERS AS ANXIOLYTICS FREQUENTLY. RESULTS: FINALLY, WE FIND THAT THE RULES ASSOCIATING WITH NRT COMBINATION WITH BLOOD TESTS MAY IMPLY THAT THE USE OF NRT COMBINATION THERAPY IN SMOKERS WITH CHRONIC ILLNESS MAY RESULT IN LOWER ABSTINENCE. FURTHER LARGE-SCALE SURVEYS COMPARING VARENICLINE OR BUPROPION WITH NRT COMBINATION IN SMOKERS WITH A CHRONIC DISEASE ARE WARRANTED. THE APRIORI ALGORITHM SUFFERS FROM SOME WEAKNESSES DESPITE BEING TRANSPARENT AND STRAIGHTFORWARD. THE MAIN LIMITATION IS THE COSTLY WASTING OF TIME TO HOLD A VAST NUMBER OF CANDIDATES SETS WITH FREQUENT ITEMSETS, LOW MINIMUM SUPPORT, OR LARGE ITEMSETS.

THE NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES FOCUSED ON (A) DISCERNING THE DISCOURSE INFORMATION EXPRESSED IN QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS; (B) IDENTIFYING MEDICAL CONCEPTS THAT RELATE TO MENTAL DISORDERS; AND (C) ACCOUNTING FOR THE ROLE OF NEGATION. THE MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES RELY ON THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT (1) THE SEVERITY OF A PATIENT'S POSITIVE VALENCE SYMPTOMS EXISTS ON A LATENT CONTINUOUS SPECTRUM AND (2) ALL THE PATIENT'S ANSWERS AND NARRATIVES DOCUMENTED IN THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION RECORDS ARE INFORMED BY THE PATIENT'S LATENT SEVERITY SCORE ALONG THIS SPECTRUM. THESE ASSUMPTIONS MOTIVATED OUR TWO-STEP MACHINE LEARNING FRAMEWORK FOR AUTOMATICALLY RECOGNIZING PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOM SEVERITY. IN THE FIRST STEP, THE LATENT CONTINUOUS SEVERITY SCORE IS INFERRED FROM EACH RECORD; IN THE SECOND STEP, THE SEVERITY SCORE IS MAPPED TO ONE OF THE FOUR DISCRETE SEVERITY LEVELS USED IN THE CEGS/N-GRID CHALLENGE. WE EVALUATED THREE METHODS FOR INFERRING THE LATENT SEVERITY SCORE ASSOCIATED WITH EACH RECORD: (I) POINTWISE RIDGE REGRESSION; (II) PAIRWISE COMPARISON-BASED CLASSIFICATION; AND (III) A HYBRID APPROACH COMBINING POINTWISE REGRESSION AND THE PAIRWISE CLASSIFIER.

METHODS: WE ANALYZED 241 CRITIQUES FROM 79 SUMMARY STATEMENTS FOR 51 R01 RENEWALS AWARDED TO 45 INVESTIGATORS (64% MALE, 89% WHITE, 80% PHD) AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON BETWEEN 2010 AND 2014. WE USED LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION TO DISCOVER EVALUATIVE ""TOPICS"" (I.E., WORDS THAT CO-OCCUR WITH HIGH PROBABILITY). WE THEN QUALITATIVELY EXAMINED THE CONTEXT IN WHICH EVALUATIVE WORDS OCCURRED FOR MALE AND FEMALE INVESTIGATORS. WE ALSO EXAMINED SEX DIFFERENCES IN ASSIGNED SCORES CONTROLLING FOR INVESTIGATOR PRODUCTIVITY. RESULTS: TEXT ANALYSIS RESULTS SHOWED THAT MALE INVESTIGATORS WERE DESCRIBED AS ""LEADERS"" AND ""PIONEERS"" IN THEIR ""FIELDS,"" WITH ""HIGHLY INNOVATIVE"" AND ""HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT RESEARCH."" BY COMPARISON, FEMALE INVESTIGATORS WERE CHARACTERIZED AS HAVING ""EXPERTISE"" AND WORKING IN ""EXCELLENT"" ENVIRONMENTS. APPLICATIONS FROM MEN RECEIVED SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER PRIORITY, APPROACH, AND SIGNIFICANCE SCORES, WHICH COULD NOT BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY DIFFERENCES IN PRODUCTIVITY. CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS CONFIRM OUR PREVIOUS ANALYSES SUGGESTING THAT GENDER STEREOTYPES OPERATE IN R01 GRANT PEER REVIEW. REVIEWERS MAY MORE EASILY VIEW MALE THAN FEMALE INVESTIGATORS AS SCIENTIFIC LEADERS WITH SIGNIFICANT AND INNOVATIVE RESEARCH, AND SCORE THEIR APPLICATIONS MORE COMPETITIVELY.

"523","RJ L, 2020, ","CULTUROMICS IS EMERGING AS AN IMPORTANT FIELD WITHIN SCIENCE, AS A WAY TO MEASURE ATTITUDES AND BELIEFS AND THEIR DYNAMICS ACROSS TIME AND SPACE VIA QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF DIGITIZED DATA FROM LITERATURE, NEWS, FILM, SOCIAL MEDIA, AND MORE. SENTIMENT ANALYSIS IS A CULTUROMICS TOOL THAT, WITHIN THE LAST DECADE, HAS PROVIDED A MEANS TO QUANTIFY THE POLARITY OF ATTITUDES EXPRESSED WITHIN VARIOUS MEDIA. CONSERVATION SCIENCE IS A CRISIS DISCIPLINE; THEREFORE, ACCURATE AND EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION ARE PARAMOUNT. WE INVESTIGATED HOW CONSERVATION SCIENTISTS COMMUNICATE THEIR FINDINGS THROUGH SCIENTIFIC JOURNAL ARTICLES. WE ANALYZED 15,001 ABSTRACTS FROM ARTICLES PUBLISHED FROM 1998 TO 2017 IN 6 CONSERVATION-FOCUSED JOURNALS SELECTED BASED ON INDEXING IN SCIENTIFIC DATABASES. ARTICLES WERE CATEGORIZED BY YEAR, FOCAL TAXA, AND THE CONSERVATION STATUS OF THE FOCAL SPECIES. WE CALCULATED MEAN SENTIMENT SCORE FOR EACH ABSTRACT (MEAN ADJUSTED Z SCORE) BASED ON 4 LEXICONS (JOCKERS-RINKER, NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL, BING, AND AFINN). WE FOUND A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE ANNUAL TREND IN THE SENTIMENT SCORES OF ARTICLES. WE ALSO OBSERVED A SIGNIFICANT TREND TOWARD INCREASING NEGATIVITY ALONG THE SPECTRUM OF CONSERVATION STATUS CATEGORIES (I.E., FROM LEAST CONCERN TO EXTINCT). THERE WERE SOME CLEAR DIFFERENCES IN THE SENTIMENTS WITH WHICH RESEARCH ON DIFFERENT TAXA WAS REPORTED, HOWEVER. FOR EXAMPLE, ABSTRACTS MENTIONING LOBE FINNED FISHES TENDED TO HAVE HIGH SENTIMENT SCORES, WHICH COULD BE RELATED TO THE REDISCOVERY OF THE COELACANTH DRIVING A POSITIVE NARRATIVE. CONTRASTINGLY, ABSTRACTS MENTIONING ELASMOBRANCHS HAD LOW SCORES, POSSIBLY REFLECTING THE NEGATIVE SENTIMENT SCORE ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORD SHARK.

IN AN ARCHIVAL SAMPLE OF MOVIE SCRIPTS, WE TESTED WHETHER GENRE-TYPICALITY PREDICTED FILM RATINGS AS A FUNCTION OF RATER ROLE (NOVICE AUDIENCE MEMBER OR EXPERT FILM CRITIC). GENRE-TYPICALITY WAS OPERATIONALIZED AS THE PROFILE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN LINGUISTIC ARCS (ACROSS FIVE SEGMENTS, OR ACTS) FOR EACH SCRIPT AND WITHIN-GENRE AVERAGES. WE PREDICTED (1) THAT CRITICS WOULD PREFER MORE DISFLUENT (GENRE-ATYPICAL) FILMS AND GENERAL AUDIENCES WOULD PREFER FLUENT (GENRE-TYPICAL) FILMS, AND (2) THAT THESE DIFFERENCES WOULD BE MOST PRONOUNCED FOR GENRES EXPECTED TO BE MORE ENTERTAINING (E.G., ACTION/ADVENTURE) THAN CHALLENGING (E.G., TRAGEDY).

MACHINE LEARNING AND NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES CAN BE APPLIED TO THESE LARGE VOLUMES OF UNSTRUCTURED TEXT DISCUSSIONS ACCUMULATED IN OSG FOR INTELLIGENT EXTRACTION OF PATIENT-REPORTED DEMOGRAPHICS, BEHAVIOURS, DECISIONS, TREATMENT, SIDE EFFECTS AND EXPRESSIONS OF EMOTIONS. NEW INSIGHTS FROM THE FUSION AND SYNTHESIS OF SUCH DIVERSE PATIENT-REPORTED INFORMATION, AS EXPRESSED THROUGHOUT THE PATIENT JOURNEY FROM DIAGNOSIS TO TREATMENT AND RECOVERY, CAN CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS INFORMED DECISION-MAKING ON PERSONALIZED HEALTHCARE DELIVERY AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF HEALTHCARE POLICY GUIDELINES. METHODS AND FINDINGS: WE HAVE DESIGNED AND DEVELOPED AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BASED ANALYTICS FRAMEWORK USING MACHINE LEARNING AND NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES FOR INTELLIGENT ANALYSIS AND AUTOMATED AGGREGATION OF PATIENT INFORMATION AND INTERACTION TRAJECTORIES IN ONLINE SUPPORT GROUPS. ALONGSIDE THE SOCIAL INTERACTIONS ASPECT, PATIENT BEHAVIOURS, DECISIONS, DEMOGRAPHICS, CLINICAL FACTORS, EMOTIONS, AS SUBSEQUENTLY EXPRESSED OVER TIME, ARE EXTRACTED AND ANALYSED.

HOWEVER, THESE FATAL OVERDOSES ARE DIFFICULT TO CLASSIFY AS INTENTIONAL OR UNINTENTIONAL. INTENTIONAL OVERDOSE IS DIFFICULT TO DETECT, PARTIALLY DUE TO THE LACK OF PREDICTORS AND SOCIAL STIGMAS THAT PUSH INDIVIDUALS AWAY FROM SEEKING HELP. THESE INDIVIDUALS MAY INSTEAD USE WEB-BASED MEANS TO ARTICULATE THEIR CONCERNS.

METHODS: WE ANALYZED 86,581,237 PUBLIC DOMAIN ENGLISH LANGUAGE US TWEETS COLLECTED FROM AN OPEN-ACCESS PUBLIC REPOSITORY IN THREE STEPS. FIRST, WE CHARACTERIZED THE EVOLUTION OF HASHTAGS OVER TIME USING LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION (LDA) TOPIC MODELING. SECOND, WE INCREASED THE GRANULARITY OF THIS ANALYSIS BY DOWNLOADING TWITTER TIMELINES OF A LARGE COHORT OF INDIVIDUALS (N=354,738) IN 20 MAJOR US CITIES TO ASSESS CHANGES IN SOCIAL MEDIA USE. FINALLY, USING THIS TIMELINE DATA, WE EXAMINED COLLECTIVE SHIFTS IN PUBLIC MOOD IN RELATION TO EVOLVING PANDEMIC NEWS CYCLES BY ANALYZING THE AVERAGE DAILY SENTIMENT OF ALL TIMELINE TWEETS WITH THE VALENCE AWARE DICTIONARY AND SENTIMENT REASONER (VADER) TOOL. RESULTS: LDA TOPICS GENERATED IN THE EARLY MONTHS OF THE DATA SET CORRESPONDED TO MAJOR COVID-19-SPECIFIC EVENTS. HOWEVER, AS STATE AND MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS BEGAN ISSUING STAY-AT-HOME ORDERS, LATENT THEMES SHIFTED TOWARD US-RELATED LIFESTYLE CHANGES RATHER THAN GLOBAL PANDEMIC-RELATED EVENTS. SOCIAL MEDIA VOLUME ALSO INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY, PEAKING DURING STAY-AT-HOME MANDATES. FINALLY, VADER SENTIMENT ANALYSIS SCORES OF USER TIMELINES WERE INITIALLY HIGH AND STABLE BUT DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY, AND CONTINUOUSLY, BY LATE MARCH. CONCLUSIONS: OUR FINDINGS UNDERSCORE THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC ON OVERALL POPULATION SENTIMENT. INCREASED USE RATES SUGGEST THAT, FOR SOME, SOCIAL MEDIA MAY BE A COPING MECHANISM TO COMBAT FEELINGS OF ISOLATION RELATED TO LONG-TERM SOCIAL DISTANCING. HOWEVER, IN LIGHT OF THE DOCUMENTED NEGATIVE EFFECT OF HEAVY SOCIAL MEDIA USE ON MENTAL HEALTH, SOCIAL MEDIA MAY FURTHER EXACERBATE NEGATIVE FEELINGS IN THE LONG-TERM FOR MANY INDIVIDUALS. THUS, CONSIDERING THE OVERBURDENED US MENTAL HEALTH CARE STRUCTURE, THESE FINDINGS HAVE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR ONGOING MITIGATION EFFORTS.",1,1,0

OBTAINING SUCH PREDICTORS IS CHALLENGING AND METHODOLOGICALLY LIMITED, FOR EXAMPLE BY INDIVIDUALS' DISTRESS, AROUSAL, AND REDUCED INTROSPECTIVE ABILITY. WE INVESTIGATED THE PREDICTIVE POWER OF LANGUAGE-BASED, IMPLICIT MARKERS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL PROCESSES (N = 163) DERIVED FROM COMPUTERIZED TEXT-ANALYSIS OF TRAUMA AND CONTROL NARRATIVES PROVIDED WITHIN 18 DAYS POST-TRAUMA. TRAUMA NARRATIVES WITH FEWER COGNITIVE PROCESSING WORDS (INDICATING LESS COGNITIVE ELABORATION), MORE DEATH-RELATED WORDS (INDICATING PERCEIVED THREAT TO LIFE), AND MORE FIRST-PERSON SINGULAR PRONOUNS (INDICATING SELF-IMMERSED PROCESSING) PREDICTED GREATER PTSD SYMPTOMS AT 6 MONTHS. THESE EFFECTS WERE SPECIFIC TO TRAUMA NARRATIVES AND HELD AFTER CONTROLLING FOR EARLY PTSD SYMPTOM SEVERITY AND VERBAL INTELLIGENCE. WHEN SELF-REPORT QUESTIONNAIRES OF RELATED PROCESSES WERE CONSIDERED TOGETHER WITH THE TRAUMA NARRATIVE LINGUISTIC PREDICTORS, USE OF MORE FIRST-PERSON SINGULAR PRONOUNS REMAINED A SIGNIFICANT PREDICTOR ALONGSIDE SELF-REPORTED MENTAL DEFEAT.

HOWEVER, DOCTORS' OPINIONS ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A 'GOOD' PATIENT HAVE NOT BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY INVESTIGATED. AIM: TO EXPLORE HOW PATIENTS DEFINE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A 'GOOD' AND A 'BAD' DOCTOR, AND HOW DOCTORS DEFINE A 'GOOD' AND A 'BAD' PATIENT. MATERIAL AND METHODS: WE SURVEYED A COHORT OF 107 CONSECUTIVE PATIENTS ATTENDING A COMMUNITY TEACHING HOSPITAL IN FEBRUARY 2019, WHO WERE ASKED TO DEFINE THE DESIRABLE CHARACTERISTICS OF A GOOD/BAD DOCTOR. ADDITIONALLY, A COHORT OF 115 PHYSICIANS WORKING AT THE SAME HOSPITAL WAS ASKED TO DEFINE THE DESIRABLE CHARACTERISTICS OF A GOOD/BAD PATIENT. RESPONSES WERE SUBJECTED TO CONTENT ANALYSIS. SIMULTANEOUSLY, AN ALGORITHM IN PYTHON WAS USED TO AUTOMATICALLY CATEGORIZE RESPONSES THROUGHOUT TEXT-MINING. RESULTS: THE PREDOMINANT PATIENTS' PERSPECTIVE ALLUDED TO DESIRABLE PERSONAL QUALITIES MORE IMPORTANTLY THAN PROFICIENCY IN KNOWLEDGE AND TECHNICAL SKILLS. DOCTORS WOULD BE SATISFIED IF PATIENTS MANIFESTED POSITIVE PERSONALITY CHARACTERISTICS, WERE PRONE TO AVOID DECISIONAL AND PERSONAL CONFLICTS, HAD A HIGH ADHERENCE TO TREATMENT, AND TRUSTED THE DOCTOR. THE TEXT-MINING ALGORITHM WAS ACCURATE TO CLASSIFY INDIVIDUALS' OPINIONS. CONCLUSIONS: IDEALLY, FUSING THE SKILLS OF THE SCIENTIST TO THE REFLECTIVE CAPABILITIES OF THE MEDICAL HUMANIST WILL FULFILL THE ARCHETYPE OF WHAT PATIENTS CONSIDER TO BE A 'GOOD' DOCTOR.

PARTICULARLY, IN ITALY, THERE IS A LIVELY DISCUSSION ON THE WEB REGARDING VACCINES ALSO BECAUSE THERE IS LOW VACCINATION COVERAGE, VACCINES HESITANCY, AND ANTI-VACCINE MOVEMENTS. FOR THESE REASONS, IN 2017, INSTITUTIONS HAVE INTRODUCED A LAW TO FORCE CHILDREN TO MAKE TEN COMPULSORY VACCINES FOR SCHOOL ATTENDANCE AND PROPOSED A VACCINATION CAMPAIGN. ON SOCIAL NETWORKS, THIS LAW HAS FOSTERED A FIERCE DISCUSSION BETWEEN PRO-VACCINATIONS AND ANTI-VACCINATIONS PEOPLE. THIS PAPER AIMS TO UNDERSTAND IF AND HOW THE POPULATION'S OPINION HAS CHANGED BEFORE THE LAW AND AFTER THE VACCINATION CAMPAIGN USING THE TITLES OF THE VIDEOS UPLOADED ON YOUTUBE IN THESE PERIODS. METHOD: USING CO-OCCURRENCE NETWORK (CON) AND SENTIMENT ANALYSIS, WE ANALYSED THE TOPICS OF YOUTUBE ITALIAN VIDEOS ON VACCINES IN 2017 AND 2018. RESULTS: THE CON CONFIRMS THAT VACCINATIONS WERE VERY DISAPPROVED BEFORE THE LAW. INSTEAD, AFTER THE COMMUNICATION CAMPAIGN, PEOPLE START TO BE LESS CRITICAL. THE SENTIMENT ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THE INTENSE VACCINATION CAMPAIGN ALSO PROMOTED BY MEDICAL DOCTORS PUSHED THE SENTIMENT TO CHANGE POLARITY FROM A PREVAILING NEGATIVE OPINION IN 2017 (52% NEGATIVE) TO A POSITIVE ONE IN 2018 (54% POSITIVE).

OBJECTIVE: OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO AUTOMATICALLY EXTRACT FROM EHRS THE DESCRIPTION OF BEHAVIORS NOTED BY THE CLINICIANS IN EVIDENCE OF THE DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA IN THE DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL OF MENTAL DISORDERS (DSM). PREVIOUSLY, WE REPORTED ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF ENTIRE EHRS AS ASD OR NOT. IN THIS WORK, WE FOCUS ON THE EXTRACTION OF INDIVIDUAL EXPRESSIONS OF THE DIFFERENT ASD CRITERIA IN THE TEXT. WE INTEND TO FACILITATE LARGE-SCALE SURVEILLANCE EFFORTS FOR ASD AND SUPPORT ANALYSIS OF CHANGES OVER TIME AS WELL AS ENABLE INTEGRATION WITH OTHER RELEVANT DATA. METHODS: WE DEVELOPED A NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) PARSER TO EXTRACT EXPRESSIONS OF 12 DSM CRITERIA USING 104 PATTERNS AND 92 LEXICONS (1787 TERMS). THE PARSER IS RULE-BASED TO ENABLE PRECISE EXTRACTION OF THE ENTITIES FROM THE TEXT. THE ENTITIES THEMSELVES ARE ENCOMPASSED IN THE EHRS AS VERY DIVERSE EXPRESSIONS OF THE DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA WRITTEN BY DIFFERENT PEOPLE AT DIFFERENT TIMES (CLINICIANS, SPEECH PATHOLOGISTS, AMONG OTHERS). DUE TO THE SPARSITY OF THE DATA, A RULE-BASED APPROACH IS BEST SUITED UNTIL LARGER DATASETS CAN BE GENERATED FOR MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS. RESULTS: WE EVALUATED OUR RULE-BASED PARSER AND COMPARED IT WITH A MACHINE LEARNING BASELINE (DECISION TREE). USING A TEST SET OF 6636 SENTENCES (50 EHRS), WE FOUND THAT OUR PARSER ACHIEVED 76% PRECISION, 43% RECALL (IE, SENSITIVITY), AND >99% SPECIFICITY FOR CRITERION EXTRACTION. THE PERFORMANCE WAS BETTER FOR THE RULE-BASED APPROACH THAN FOR THE MACHINE LEARNING BASELINE (60% PRECISION AND 30% RECALL). FOR SOME INDIVIDUAL CRITERIA, PRECISION WAS AS HIGH AS 97% AND RECALL 57%. SINCE PRECISION WAS VERY HIGH, WE WERE ASSURED THAT CRITERIA WERE RARELY ASSIGNED INCORRECTLY, AND OUR NUMBERS PRESENTED A LOWER BOUND OF THEIR PRESENCE IN EHRS. WE THEN CONDUCTED A CASE STUDY AND PARSED 4480 NEW EHRS COVERING 10 YEARS OF SURVEILLANCE RECORDS FROM THE ARIZONA DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM.

AIMS: TO INVESTIGATE THE LINK BETWEEN ACUTE SUICIDALITY AND LANGUAGE USE AS WELL AS ACTIVITY ON INSTAGRAM. METHOD: A TOTAL OF 52 PARTICIPANTS, AGED ON AVERAGE AROUND 16 YEARS, WHO HAD POSTED PICTURES OF NON-SUICIDAL SELF-INJURY ON INSTAGRAM, AND REPORTED A LIFETIME HISTORY OF SUICIDAL IDEATION, WERE INTERVIEWED USING INSTAGRAM MESSENGER. OF THOSE PARTICIPANTS, 45.5% REPORTED SUICIDAL IDEATION ON THE DAY OF THE INTERVIEW (ACUTE SUICIDAL IDEATION). QUALITATIVE TEXT ANALYSIS (SOFTWARE ATLAS.TI 7) WAS USED TO INVESTIGATE EXPERIENCES WITH EXPRESSIONS OF ACTIVE SUICIDAL THOUGHTS ON INSTAGRAM. QUANTITATIVE TEXT ANALYSIS OF LANGUAGE USE IN THE INTERVIEWS AND DIRECTLY ON INSTAGRAM (IN PICTURE CAPTIONS) WAS PERFORMED USING THE LINGUISTIC INQUIRY AND WORD COUNT SOFTWARE. LANGUAGE MARKERS IN THE INTERVIEWS AND IN PICTURE CAPTIONS, AS WELL AS ACTIVITY ON INSTAGRAM WERE ADDED TO REGRESSION ANALYSES, IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE PREDICTORS FOR CURRENT SUICIDAL IDEATION. RESULTS: MOST PARTICIPANTS (80%) HAD COME ACROSS EXPRESSIONS OF ACTIVE SUICIDAL THOUGHTS ON INSTAGRAM AND 25% HAD EXPRESSED ACTIVE SUICIDAL THOUGHTS THEMSELVES. PARTICIPANTS WITH ACUTE SUICIDAL IDEATION USED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE NEGATIVE EMOTION WORDS (COHEN'S D = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.088-1.232) AND WORDS EXPRESSING OVERALL AFFECT (COHEN'S D = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.001-1.138) IN INTERVIEWS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: CANCER-RELATED TWITTER ACCOUNTS AND THEIR TWEETS WERE OBTAINED THROUGH USING TWEEPY (PYTHON LIBRARY). MULTIPLE TEXT CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS WERE TESTED TO IDENTIFY THE MODELS WITH BEST PERFORMANCE IN CLASSIFYING THE ACCOUNTS INTO INDIVIDUAL AND ORGANIZATION. CHEMOTHERAPY-SPECIFIC TWEETS WERE EXTRACTED FROM HISTORICAL TWEETSET, AND THE CONTENT OF THESE TWEETS WAS ANALYZED USING TOPIC MODEL, SENTIMENT ANALYSIS AND WORD CO-OCCURRENCE NETWORK. RESULTS: USING THE DESCRIPTION IN TWITTER USERS' PROFILES, THE ACCOUNTS RELATED WITH CANCER WERE COLLECTED AND CODED AS INDIVIDUAL OR ORGANIZATION. WE EMPLOYED LONG SHORT TERM MEMORY (LSTM) NETWORK WITH GLOVE WORD EMBEDDINGS TO IDENTIFY THE USER INTO INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS WITH ACCURACY OF 85.2%. 13, 273 AND 14,051 PUBLICLY AVAILABLE CHEMOTHERAPY-RELATED TWEETS WERE RETRIEVED FROM INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS, RESPECTIVELY.

THIS STUDY DESCRIBES AND EVALUATES A NOVEL METHOD OF EXTRACTING APP DATA FROM BOTH STRUCTURED AND FREE-TEXT FIELDS IN ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHRS), AND ITS USE FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES. METHODS: USING ANONYMISED EHRS, WE IDENTIFIED A COHORT OF PATIENTS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS (SMI) WHO WERE TREATED IN SOUTH LONDON AND MAUDSLEY NHS FOUNDATION TRUST MENTAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES BETWEEN 1 JANUARY AND 30 JUNE 2012. INFORMATION ABOUT ANTIPSYCHOTIC CO-PRESCRIBING WAS EXTRACTED USING A COMBINATION OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING AND A BESPOKE ALGORITHM.

RESULTS: INDIVIDUAL INSTANCES OF ANTIPSYCHOTIC PRESCRIBING WERE DETECTED WITH HIGH PRECISION (0.94 TO 0.97) AND MODERATE RECALL (0.57-0.77). WE DETECTED BASELINE APP (TWO OR MORE ANTIPSYCHOTICS PRESCRIBED IN ANY 6-WEEK WINDOW) WITH 0.92 PRECISION AND 0.74 RECALL AND LONG-TERM APP (ANTIPSYCHOTIC CO-PRESCRIBING FOR 6 MONTHS) WITH 0.94 PRECISION AND 0.60 RECALL. OF THE 7,201 SMI PATIENTS RECEIVING ACTIVE CARE DURING THE OBSERVATION PERIOD, 338 (4.7 %; 95 % CI 4.2-5.2) WERE IDENTIFIED AS RECEIVING LONG-TERM APP.

THE NECESSARY ISSUE IN THE CLINICAL DIAGNOSTIC PROCESS IS TO DETECT THE CAUSES OF THIS DISEASE (E.G., MY BODY IMAGE, FOOD, FAMILY, PEERS), WHICH THE THERAPIST GRADUALLY COMES TO BY VERIFYING ASSUMPTIONS USING PROPER METHODS AND TOOLS FOR DIAGNOSTIC PROCESS. WHEN A PERSON IS DIAGNOSED WITH ANOREXIA, A CLINICIAN (A DOCTOR, A THERAPIST OR A PSYCHOLOGIST) PROPOSES A THERAPEUTIC DIAGNOSIS AND CONSIDERS THE KIND OF TREATMENT THAT SHOULD BE APPLIED. THIS PROCESS IS ALSO CONTINUED DURING THERAPEUTIC DIAGNOSIS. IN BOTH CASES, IT IS RECOMMENDED TO APPLY COMPUTER-AIDED TOOLS DESIGNED FOR TESTING AND CONFIRMING THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE BY A PSYCHOLOGIST. THE PAPER AIMS TO PRESENT THE COMPUTER-AIDED THERAPEUTIC DIAGNOSIS METHOD FOR ANOREXIA. THE PROPOSED METHOD CONSISTS OF 4 STAGES: FREE STATEMENTS OF A PATIENT ABOUT HIS/HER BODY IMAGE, THE GENERAL SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF STATEMENT BASED ON RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK, ASSESSMENT OF THE INTENSITY OF FIVE BASIC EMOTIONS: HAPPINESS, ANGER, SADNESS, FEAR AND DISGUST (USING THE NENCKI AFFECTIVE WORD LIST AND CONVERSION OF WORDS TO THEIR BASIC FORM), AND THE ASSESSMENT OF PARTICULAR AREAS OF DIFFICULTIES-THE SENTIMENT ANALYSIS BASED ON THE DICTIONARY APPROACH WAS APPLIED. RESULTS: THE SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF A DOCUMENT ACHIEVED 72% AND 51% OF EFFECTIVENESS, RESPECTIVELY, FOR RNN AND DICTIONARY-BASED METHODS.

THE PROPORTION OF TWEETS WITH POSITIVE SENTIMENT RANGED FROM 13% IN MANILA TO 56% IN LOS ANGELES, CA, WITH A MEDIAN OF 29% ACROSS CITIES. TEMPORALLY, THE PROPORTION OF TWEETS WITH POSITIVE SENTIMENT RANGED FROM 24% AT 1600 TO 38% AT 2400, WITH A MEDIAN OF 32%. THE TWITTER-BASED SOCIAL NETWORKS PERTAINING TO PAIN EXHIBITED GREATER SPARSITY AND LOWER CONNECTEDNESS THAN DID THOSE SOCIAL NETWORKS PERTAINING TO COMMON TERMS SUCH AS APPLE, MANCHESTER UNITED, AND OBAMA.

PATIENTS TYPICALLY PRESENT MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS, REQUIRING PHYSICIANS TO DECIDE HOW TO BALANCE COMPETING DEMANDS. HOW THIS TIME IS ALLOCATED HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR PATIENT SATISFACTION, PAYMENTS, AND QUALITY OF CARE. WE INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MACHINE LEARNING METHODS FOR AUTOMATED ANNOTATION OF MEDICAL TOPICS IN PATIENT-PROVIDER DIALOG TRANSCRIPTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: WE USED DIALOG TRANSCRIPTS FROM 279 PRIMARY CARE VISITS TO PREDICT TALK-TURN TOPIC LABELS. DIFFERENT MACHINE LEARNING MODELS WERE TRAINED TO OPERATE ON SINGLE OR MULTIPLE LOCAL TALK-TURNS (LOGISTIC CLASSIFIERS, SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES, GATED RECURRENT UNITS) AS WELL AS SEQUENTIAL MODELS THAT INTEGRATE INFORMATION ACROSS TALK-TURN SEQUENCES (CONDITIONAL RANDOM FIELDS, HIDDEN MARKOV MODELS, AND HIERARCHICAL GATED RECURRENT UNITS). RESULTS: EVALUATION WAS PERFORMED USING CROSS-VALIDATION TO MEASURE 1) CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY FOR TALK-TURNS AND 2) PRECISION, RECALL, AND F1 SCORES AT THE VISIT LEVEL. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOWED THAT SEQUENTIAL MODELS HAD HIGHER CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY AT THE TALK-TURN LEVEL AND HIGHER PRECISION AT THE VISIT LEVEL. INDEPENDENT MODELS HAD HIGHER RECALL SCORES AT THE VISIT LEVEL COMPARED WITH SEQUENTIAL MODELS. CONCLUSIONS: INCORPORATING SEQUENTIAL INFORMATION ACROSS TALK-TURNS IMPROVES THE ACCURACY OF TOPIC PREDICTION IN PATIENT-PROVIDER DIALOG BY SMOOTHING OUT NOISY INFORMATION FROM TALK-TURNS. ALTHOUGH THE RESULTS ARE PROMISING, MORE ADVANCED PREDICTION TECHNIQUES AND LARGER LABELED DATASETS WILL LIKELY BE REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE PREDICTION PERFORMANCE APPROPRIATE FOR REAL-WORLD CLINICAL APPLICATIONS.",0,1,0

METHODS: WE PROPOSE A METHOD FOR APPLYING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TO DERIVE DIMENSIONAL MEASURES OF PSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOMS FROM QUESTIONNAIRE DATA. WE UTILIZED NINE SELF-REPORT SYMPTOM MEASURES DRAWN FROM A LARGE CELLULAR BIOBANKING STUDY THAT ENROLLED INDIVIDUALS WITH MOOD AND PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS, AS WELL AS HEALTHY CONTROLS. TO SUMMARIZE QUESTIONNAIRE RESULTS WE USED WORD EMBEDDINGS, A TECHNIQUE TO REPRESENT WORDS AS NUMERIC VECTORS PRESERVING SEMANTIC AND SYNTACTIC MEANING. A LOW-DIMENSIONAL APPROXIMATION TO THE EMBEDDING SPACE WAS USED TO DERIVE THE PROPOSED SUCCINCT SUMMARY OF SYMPTOM PROFILES. TO VALIDATE OUR EMBEDDING-BASED DISEASE PROFILES, THESE WERE COMPARED TO PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF AXIS I DIAGNOSES DERIVED FROM STRUCTURED CLINICAL INTERVIEW, AND TO OBJECTIVE NEUROCOGNITIVE TESTING. RESULTS: UNSUPERVISED AND SUPERVISED CLASSIFICATION TO DISTINGUISH PRESENCE/ABSENCE OF AXIS I DISORDERS USING SURVEY-LEVEL EMBEDDINGS REMAINED DISCRIMINATIVE, WITH AREA UNDER THE RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC CURVE UP TO 0.85, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) (0.74,0.91) USING GAUSSIAN MIXTURE MODELING, AND CROSS-VALIDATED AREA UNDER THE RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC CURVE 0.91, 95% CI (0.88,0.94) USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION.

EACH TWEET WAS MANUALLY CLASSIFIED USING A TRIAXIAL SCHEME, CAPTURING GENRE, THEME, AND SENTIMENT. USING THE COLLECTED DATA, MACHINE-LEARNING CLASSIFIERS WERE TRAINED TO DETECT TOBACCO-RELATED VS IRRELEVANT TWEETS AS WELL AS POSITIVE VS NEGATIVE SENTIMENT, USING NAVE BAYES, K-NEAREST NEIGHBORS, AND SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM) ALGORITHMS. FINALLY, PHI CONTINGENCY COEFFICIENTS WERE COMPUTED BETWEEN EACH OF THE CATEGORIES TO DISCOVER EMERGENT PATTERNS. RESULTS: THE MOST PREVALENT GENRES WERE FIRST- AND SECOND-HAND EXPERIENCE AND OPINION, AND THE MOST FREQUENT THEMES WERE HOOKAH, CESSATION, AND PLEASURE. SENTIMENT TOWARD TOBACCO WAS OVERALL MORE POSITIVE (1939/4215, 46% OF TWEETS) THAN NEGATIVE (1349/4215, 32%) OR NEUTRAL AMONG TWEETS MENTIONING IT, EVEN EXCLUDING THE 9% OF TWEETS CATEGORIZED AS MARKETING. THREE SEPARATE METRICS CONVERGED TO SUPPORT AN EMERGENT DISTINCTION BETWEEN, ON ONE HAND, HOOKAH AND ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES CORRESPONDING TO POSITIVE SENTIMENT, AND ON THE OTHER HAND, TRADITIONAL TOBACCO PRODUCTS AND MORE GENERAL REFERENCES CORRESPONDING TO NEGATIVE SENTIMENT. THESE METRICS INCLUDED CORRELATIONS BETWEEN CATEGORIES IN THE ANNOTATION SCHEME (PHIHOOKAH-POSITIVE=0.39; PHI(E-CIGS)-POSITIVE=0.19); CORRELATIONS BETWEEN SEARCH KEYWORDS AND SENTIMENT (=414.50, P<.001, CRAMER'S V=0.36), AND THE MOST DISCRIMINATING UNIGRAM FEATURES FOR POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SENTIMENT RANKED BY LOG ODDS RATIO IN THE MACHINE LEARNING COMPONENT OF THE STUDY. IN THE AUTOMATED CLASSIFICATION TASKS, SVMS USING A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF UNIGRAM FEATURES (500) ACHIEVED BEST PERFORMANCE IN DISCRIMINATING TOBACCO-RELATED FROM UNRELATED TWEETS (F SCORE=0.85). CONCLUSIONS: NOVEL INSIGHTS AVAILABLE THROUGH TWITTER FOR TOBACCO SURVEILLANCE ARE ATTESTED THROUGH THE HIGH PREVALENCE OF POSITIVE SENTIMENT. THIS POSITIVE SENTIMENT IS CORRELATED IN COMPLEX WAYS WITH SOCIAL IMAGE, PERSONAL EXPERIENCE, AND RECENTLY POPULAR PRODUCTS SUCH AS HOOKAH AND ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES. SEVERAL APPARENT PERCEPTUAL DISCONNECTS BETWEEN THESE PRODUCTS AND THEIR HEALTH EFFECTS SUGGEST OPPORTUNITIES FOR TOBACCO CONTROL EDUCATION. FINALLY, MACHINE CLASSIFICATION OF TOBACCO-RELATED POSTS SHOWS A PROMISING EDGE OVER STRICTLY KEYWORD-BASED APPROACHES, YIELDING AN IMPROVED SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO IN TWITTER DATA AND PAVING THE WAY FOR AUTOMATED TOBACCO SURVEILLANCE APPLICATIONS.",1,1,1

OBJECTIVES: WE AIMED TO UTILIZE INFORMATION AVAILABLE IN AN ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD (EMR) AND ENDOSCOPY SCHEDULING SYSTEM TO CREATE A PREDICTIVE MODEL FOR NO-SHOW RISK, AND TO SIMULTANEOUSLY EVALUATE THE ROLE FOR NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) IN DEVELOPING SUCH A MODEL. DESIGN: THIS WAS A RETROSPECTIVE OBSERVATIONAL STUDY USING DISCOVERY AND VALIDATION PHASES TO DESIGN A COLONOSCOPY NON-ADHERENCE PREDICTION MODEL. AN NLP-DERIVED VARIABLE CALLED THE NON-ADHERENCE RATIO (""NAR"") WAS DEVELOPED, VALIDATED, AND INCLUDED IN THE MODEL. PARTICIPANTS: PATIENTS SCHEDULED FOR OUTPATIENT COLONOSCOPY AT AN ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER (AMC) THAT IS PART OF A MULTI-HOSPITAL HEALTH SYSTEM, 2009 TO 2011, WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. MAIN MEASURES: ODDS RATIOS FOR NON-ADHERENCE WERE CALCULATED FOR ALL VARIABLES IN THE DISCOVERY COHORT, AND AN AREA UNDER THE RECEIVER OPERATING CURVE (AUC) WAS CALCULATED FOR THE FINAL NON-ADHERENCE PREDICTION MODEL. KEY RESULTS: THE NON-ADHERENCE MODEL INCLUDED SIX VARIABLES: 1) GENDER; 2) HISTORY OF PSYCHIATRIC ILLNESS, 3) NAR; 4) WAIT TIME IN MONTHS; 5) NUMBER OF PRIOR MISSED ENDOSCOPIES; AND 6) EDUCATION LEVEL. THE MODEL ACHIEVED DISCRIMINATION IN THE VALIDATION COHORT (AUC= =70.2 %). AT A THRESHOLD NON-ADHERENCE SCORE OF 0.46, THE MODEL'S SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY WERE 33 % AND 92 %, RESPECTIVELY. REMOVING THE NAR FROM THE MODEL SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED ITS PREDICTIVE POWER (AUC = 64.3 %, DIFFERENCE = 5.9 %, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A SIX-VARIABLE MODEL USING READILY AVAILABLE CLINICAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION DEMONSTRATED ACCURACY FOR PREDICTING COLONOSCOPY NON-ADHERENCE. THE NAR, A NOVEL VARIABLE DEVELOPED USING NLP TECHNOLOGY, SIGNIFICANTLY STRENGTHENED THIS MODEL'S PREDICTIVE POWER.",1,1,0

DUP ESTIMATION REQUIRES KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHEN PSYCHOSIS SYMPTOMS FIRST STARTED (SYMPTOM ONSET), AND WHEN PSYCHOSIS TREATMENT WAS INITIATED. ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHRS) REPRESENT A USEFUL RESOURCE FOR RETROSPECTIVE CLINICAL STUDIES ON DUP, BUT THE CORE INFORMATION UNDERLYING THIS CONSTRUCT IS MOST LIKELY TO LIE IN FREE TEXT, MEANING IT IS NOT READILY AVAILABLE FOR CLINICAL RESEARCH. NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) IS A MEANS TO ADDRESSING THIS PROBLEM BY AUTOMATICALLY EXTRACTING RELEVANT INFORMATION IN A STRUCTURED FORM. AS A FIRST STEP, IT IS IMPORTANT TO IDENTIFY APPROPRIATE DOCUMENTS, I.E., THOSE THAT ARE LIKELY TO INCLUDE THE INFORMATION OF INTEREST. NEXT, TEMPORAL INFORMATION EXTRACTION METHODS ARE NEEDED TO IDENTIFY TIME REFERENCES FOR EARLY PSYCHOSIS SYMPTOMS. THIS NLP CHALLENGE REQUIRES SOLVING THREE DIFFERENT TASKS: TIME EXPRESSION EXTRACTION, SYMPTOM EXTRACTION, AND TEMPORAL ""LINKING"".

TO DATE, NDES' IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION IN STUDIES HAVE MOSTLY DERIVED FROM ANSWERED ITEMS IN QUESTIONNAIRES. HOWEVER, QUESTIONNAIRES' CONTENT COULD BE RESTRICTING AND SUBJECT TO PERSONAL INTERPRETATION. WE BELIEVE THAT IN ADDITION TO THEIR USE, USER-INDEPENDENT STATISTICAL TEXT EXAMINATION OF FREELY EXPRESSED NDES NARRATIVES IS OF PRIOR IMPORTANCE TO HELP CAPTURE THE PHENOMENOLOGY OF SUCH A SUBJECTIVE AND COMPLEX PHENOMENON. TOWARDS THAT AIM, WE INCLUDED 158 PARTICIPANTS WITH A FIRSTHAND RETROSPECTIVE NARRATIVE OF THEIR SELF-REPORTED NDE THAT WE ANALYZED USING AN AUTOMATED TEXT-MINING METHOD. THE OUTPUT REVEALED THE TOP WORDS EXPRESSED BY EXPERIENCERS. IN A SECOND STEP, A HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED TO VISUALIZE THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THESE WORDS. IT REVEALED THREE MAIN CLUSTERS OF FEATURES: VISUAL PERCEPTIONS, EMOTIONS AND SPATIAL COMPONENTS.

OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF DROPOUT BEHAVIORS AMONG EATING DISORDERED INDIVIDUALS ON TWITTER AND TO ESTIMATE THE CAUSAL EFFECTS OF PERSONAL EMOTIONS AND SOCIAL NETWORKS ON DROPOUT BEHAVIORS. METHODS: USING A SNOWBALL SAMPLING METHOD, WE COLLECTED A SET OF INDIVIDUALS WHO SELF-IDENTIFIED WITH EDS IN THEIR TWITTER PROFILE DESCRIPTIONS, AS WELL AS THEIR TWEETS AND SOCIAL NETWORKS, LEADING TO 241,243,043 TWEETS FROM 208,063 USERS. INDIVIDUALS' EMOTIONS ARE MEASURED FROM THEIR LANGUAGE USE IN TWEETS USING AN AUTOMATIC SENTIMENT ANALYSIS TOOL, AND NETWORK CENTRALITIES ARE MEASURED FROM USERS' FOLLOWING NETWORKS. DROPOUT STATUSES OF USERS ARE OBSERVED IN A FOLLOW-UP PERIOD 1.5 YEARS LATER (FROM FEBRUARY 11, 2016 TO AUGUST 17, 2017). LINEAR AND SURVIVAL REGRESSION INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES MODELS ARE USED TO ESTIMATE THE EFFECTS OF EMOTIONS AND NETWORK CENTRALITY ON DROPOUT BEHAVIORS. THE AVERAGE LEVELS OF ATTRIBUTES AMONG AN INDIVIDUAL'S FOLLOWEES (IE, PEOPLE WHO ARE FOLLOWED BY THE INDIVIDUAL) ARE USED AS INSTRUMENTS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL'S ATTRIBUTES. RESULTS: EATING DISORDERED USERS HAVE RELATIVELY SHORT PERIODS OF ACTIVITY ON TWITTER WITH ONE HALF OF OUR SAMPLE DROPPING OUT AT 6 MONTHS AFTER ACCOUNT CREATION. ACTIVE USERS SHOW MORE NEGATIVE EMOTIONS AND HIGHER NETWORK CENTRALITIES THAN DROPPED-OUT USERS. ACTIVE USERS TEND TO CONNECT TO OTHER ACTIVE USERS, WHEREAS DROPPED-OUT USERS TEND TO CLUSTER TOGETHER. ESTIMATION RESULTS SUGGEST THAT USERS' EMOTIONS AND NETWORK CENTRALITIES HAVE CAUSAL EFFECTS ON THEIR DROPOUT BEHAVIORS ON TWITTER. MORE SPECIFICALLY, USERS WITH POSITIVE EMOTIONS ARE MORE LIKELY TO DROP OUT AND HAVE SHORTER LASTING PERIODS OF ACTIVITY ONLINE THAN USERS WITH NEGATIVE EMOTIONS, WHEREAS CENTRAL USERS IN A SOCIAL NETWORK HAVE LONGER LASTING PARTICIPATION THAN PERIPHERAL USERS.

TARGETED WEBSITES WERE CLASSIFIED AS 'PRO', 'ANTI' OR 'NEUTRAL' DEPENDING ON THEIR CLAIMS, WITH AUTHOR(S) CLASSIFIED AS 'HEALTH PROFESSIONALS', 'MASS MEDIA' OR 'LAYPERSONS'. TEXT-MINING ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED, AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED USING A CHI-SQUARED TEST. OF THE 334 WEBSITES ANALYZED, 13 CONTENT TOPICS WERE IDENTIFIED. THE THREE MOST FREQUENTLY APPEARING CONTENT TOPICS ON PRO-VACCINATION WEBSITES WERE VACCINATION EFFECT FOR PREVENTING SERIOUS CASES OF INFLUENZA, SIDE EFFECTS OF VACCINATION, AND EFFICACY RATE OF VACCINATION. THE THREE MOST FREQUENT TOPICS ON ANTI-VACCINATION WEBSITES WERE INEFFECTIVENESS OF INFLUENZA VACCINATION, TOXICITY OF VACCINATION, AND SIDE EFFECTS OF VACCINATION. THE MAIN DISSEMINATORS OF EACH TOPIC, BY AUTHOR CLASSIFICATION, WERE ALSO REVEALED. WE DISCUSS POSSIBLE TACTICS OF ONLINE INFLUENZA VACCINATION PROMOTION TO COUNTER ANTI-VACCINATION WEBSITES.",1,1,1

METHODS: WE USED LONGITUDINAL ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS FROM TWO LARGE ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTERS AND APPLIED A VALIDATED NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TOOL TO ESTIMATE COGNITIVE SYMPTOMATOLOGY. WE USED SURVIVAL ANALYSIS TO EXAMINE THE ASSOCIATION OF COGNITIVE SYMPTOMS WITH INCIDENT DEMENTIA DIAGNOSIS DURING UP TO 8 YEARS OF FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS: AMONG 267,855 HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS WITH 1,251,858 PATIENT YEARS OF FOLLOW-UP DATA, 6516 (2.4%) RECEIVED A NEW DIAGNOSIS OF DEMENTIA. IN COMPETING RISK REGRESSION, AN INCREASING COGNITIVE SYMPTOM SCORE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH EARLIER DEMENTIA DIAGNOSIS (HR 1.63; 1.54-1.72). SIMILAR RESULTS WERE OBSERVED IN THE SECOND HOSPITAL SYSTEM AND IN SUBGROUP ANALYSIS OF YOUNGER AND OLDER PATIENTS. DISCUSSION: A COGNITIVE SYMPTOM MEASURE IDENTIFIED IN DISCHARGE NOTES FACILITATED STRATIFICATION OF RISK FOR DEMENTIA UP TO 8 YEARS BEFORE DIAGNOSIS.",0,1,1
"645","C I, 2011, ","PURPOSE: RECENT GUIDELINES FOR THE MEDICAL STUDENT PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (MSPE) HAVE STANDARDIZED THE ""DEAN'S LETTER."" THE AUTHORS EXAMINED MSPES FOR LINGUISTIC DIFFERENCES ACCORDING TO STUDENT OR AUTHOR GENDER. METHOD: THIS 2009 STUDY ANALYZED 297 MSPES FOR 227 MALE AND 70 FEMALE MEDICAL STUDENTS APPLYING TO A DIAGNOSTIC RADIOLOGY RESIDENCY PROGRAM. TEXT ANALYSIS SOFTWARE IDENTIFIED WORD COUNTS, CATEGORIES, FREQUENCIES, AND CONTEXTS; FACTOR ANALYSIS DETECTED PATTERNS OF WORD CATEGORIES IN STUDENT-AUTHOR GENDER PAIRINGS. RESULTS: ANALYSES SHOWED A MAIN EFFECT FOR STUDENT GENDER (P=.046) AND A GROUP DIFFERENCE FOR THE AUTHOR-STUDENT GENDER COMBINATIONS (P=.048). FEMALE AUTHORS OF MALE STUDENT MSPES USED THE FEWEST ""POSITIVE EMOTION"" WORDS (P=.006). MSPES BY MALE AUTHORS WERE SHORTER THAN THOSE BY FEMALES (P=.014). MSPES FOR STUDENTS RANKED IN THE NATIONAL RESIDENT MATCHING PROGRAM CONTAINED MORE ""STANDOUT"" (P=.002) AND ""POSITIVE EMOTION"" (P=.001) WORDS. THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES IN THE AUTHOR-GENDER PAIRS IN THE PROPORTION OF STUDENTS RANKED, ALTHOUGH PREDOMINANT WORD CATEGORIES DIFFERED BY AUTHOR AND STUDENT GENDER. FACTOR ANALYSIS REVEALED DIFFERENCES AMONG THE AUTHOR-STUDENT GROUPS IN PATTERNS OF CORRELATIONS AMONG WORD CATEGORIES. CONCLUSIONS: MSPES DIFFERED SLIGHTLY BUT SIGNIFICANTLY BY STUDENT AND AUTHOR GENDER. THESE DIFFERENCES MAY DERIVE FROM SOCIETAL NORMS FOR MALE AND FEMALE BEHAVIORS AND THE SUBSEQUENT LINGUISTIC INTERPRETATION OF THESE BEHAVIORS, WHICH ITSELF MAY BE COLORED BY THE OBSERVER'S GENDER.

SEVERAL IMPORTANT INFLUENCING FACTORS ARE EXAMINED AND ILLUSTRATED. USER INFORMATION FROM THE MOST RECENT POSTED MICROBLOG CONTENT OF 3793 SINA WEIBO USERS WAS COLLECTED. NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) WAS USED FOR THE SENTIMENT AND SHORT TEXT SIMILARITY ANALYSES, AND FOUR MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES, I.E., LOGISTIC REGRESSION (LR), SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES (SVM), RANDOM FOREST (RF), AND EXTREME GRADIENT BOOSTING (XGBOOST) WERE COMPARED ON DIFFERENT RUMOR REFUTING MICROBLOGS; AFTER WHICH A VALID AND ROBUST DISTINGUISHING XGBOOST MODEL WAS TRAINED AND VALIDATED TO PREDICT WHO WOULD RETWEET DISASTER-RELATED RUMOR REFUTING MICROBLOGS. COMPARED WITH TRADITIONAL PREDICTION VARIABLES THAT ONLY ACCESS USER INFORMATION, THE SIMILARITY AND SENTIMENT ANALYSES OF THE MOST RECENT USER MICROBLOG CONTENTS WERE FOUND TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE PREDICTION PRECISION AND ROBUSTNESS. THE NUMBER OF USER MICROBLOGS ALSO PROVED TO BE A VALUABLE REFERENCE FOR ALL SAMPLES DURING THE PREDICTION PROCESS. THIS PREDICTION METHODOLOGY COULD BE POSSIBLY MORE USEFUL FOR WECHAT OR FACEBOOK AS THESE HAVE RELATIVELY STABLE CLOSED-LOOP COMMUNICATION CHANNELS, WHICH MEANS THAT RUMORS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE REFUTED BY ACQUAINTANCES. THEREFORE, THE METHODOLOGY IS GOING TO BE FURTHER OPTIMIZED AND VALIDATED ON WECHAT-LIKE CHANNELS IN THE FUTURE. THE NOVEL RUMOR REFUTING APPROACH PRESENTED IN THIS RESEARCH HARNESSED NLP FOR THE USER MICROBLOG CONTENT ANALYSIS AND THEN USED THE ANALYSIS RESULTS OF NLP AS ADDITIONAL PREDICTION VARIABLES TO IDENTIFY THE ANTI-RUMOR SPREADERS.

STUDY SETTING: A MULTIHOSPITAL ACADEMIC HEALTH SYSTEM IN SOUTHEASTERN MASSACHUSETTS. STUDY DESIGN: AN OBSERVATIONAL STUDY OF 49,319 PATIENTS WITH CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE ADMITTED FROM JANUARY 1, 2011, TO DECEMBER 31, 2013, USING MULTIVARIABLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION TO ADJUST FOR PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: ALL-PAYER CLAIMS, EHR DATA, AND PHYSICIAN NOTES EXTRACTED FROM A CENTRALIZED CLINICAL REGISTRY. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: ALL SEVEN SOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS WERE IDENTIFIED AT THE HIGHEST RATES IN PHYSICIAN NOTES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE IDENTIFIED 14,872 PATIENT ADMISSIONS WITH POOR SOCIAL SUPPORT IN PHYSICIAN NOTES, INCREASING THE PREVALENCE FROM 0.4 PERCENT USING ICD-9 CODES AND STRUCTURED EHR DATA TO 16.0 PERCENT. COMPARED TO AN 18.6 PERCENT BASELINE READMISSION RATE, RISK-ADJUSTED ANALYSIS SHOWED HIGHER READMISSION RISK FOR PATIENTS WITH HOUSING INSTABILITY (READMISSION RATE 24.5 PERCENT; P < .001), DEPRESSION (20.6 PERCENT; P < .001), DRUG ABUSE (20.2 PERCENT; P = .01), AND POOR SOCIAL SUPPORT (20.0 PERCENT; P = .01).

"648","PK N, 2020, ","DISCRIMINATION IN THE WORKPLACE IS ILLEGAL, YET DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES REMAIN A PERSISTENT GLOBAL PROBLEM. TO IDENTIFY DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES IN THE WORKPLACE, JOB ADVERTISEMENT ANALYSIS WAS USED BY PREVIOUS STUDIES. HOWEVER, MOST OF THOSE STUDIES ADOPTED CONTENT ANALYSIS BY MANUALLY CODING THE TEXT FROM A LIMITED NUMBER OF SAMPLES SINCE WORKING WITH A LARGE SCALE OF JOB ADVERTISEMENTS CONSISTING OF UNSTRUCTURED TEXT DATA IS VERY CHALLENGING. ENCOUNTERING THOSE LIMITATIONS, THE PRESENT STUDY INVOLVES TEXT MINING TECHNIQUES TO IDENTIFY MULTIPLE TYPES OF DIRECT DISCRIMINATION ON A LARGE SCALE OF ONLINE JOB ADVERTISEMENTS BY DESIGNING A METHOD CALLED DIRECT DISCRIMINATION DETECTION (DDD). THE DDD IS CONSTRUCTED USING A COMBINATION OF N-GRAMS AND REGULAR EXPRESSIONS (REGEX) WITH THE EXACT MATCH PRINCIPLE OF A BOOLEAN RETRIEVAL MODEL. A TOTAL OF 8,969 ONLINE JOB ADVERTISEMENTS IN ENGLISH AND BAHASA INDONESIA, PUBLISHED FROM MAY 2005 TO DECEMBER 2017 WERE COLLECTED FROM BURSAKERJA-JATENG.COM AS THE DATA. THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT THE PRACTICES OF DIRECT DISCRIMINATION STILL EXIST DURING THE JOB-HUNTING PROCESS INCLUDING GENDER, MARITAL STATUS, PHYSICAL APPEARANCES, AND RELIGION. THE MOST RECURRENT TYPE OF DISCRIMINATION WHICH OCCURS IN JOB ADVERTISEMENTS IS BASED ON AGE (66.27%), FOLLOWED BY GENDER (38.76%), AND PHYSICAL APPEARANCES (18.42%). ADDITIONALLY, FEMALE JOB SEEKERS ARE FOUND AS THE MOST VULNERABLE PARTY TO EXPERIENCE DIRECT DISCRIMINATION DURING RECRUITMENT. THE RESULTS EXHIBIT FEMALE JOB SEEKERS FACE COMPLEX JEOPARDY IN PARTICULAR JOB POSITIONS COMPARING TO THEIR MALE COUNTERPARTS. NOT ONLY EXCLUDED BECAUSE OF THEIR GENDER, BUT FEMALE JOB SEEKERS ALSO HAD TO FULFIL MORE REQUIREMENTS FOR GETTING AN OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY FOR THE JOBS SUCH AS BEING SINGLE, STILL AT A YOUNG AGE, COMPLYING SPECIFIC PHYSICAL APPEARANCES AND PARTICULAR RELIGIOUS PREFERENCES.

TEXT MINING OF SURVIVORS' ONLINE POSTS RELATED TO SMOKING AND QUITTING COULD INFORM STRATEGIES TO REDUCE SMOKING IN THIS VULNERABLE POPULATION. METHODS: WE IDENTIFIED POSTS CONTAINING SMOKING/CESSATION-RELATED KEYWORDS FROM THE CANCER SURVIVORS NETWORK (CSN), AN ONLINE CANCER SURVIVOR COMMUNITY OF 166 000 MEMBERS AND OVER 468 000 POSTS SINCE INCEPTION. UNSUPERVISED TOPIC MODEL ANALYSIS OF POSTS SINCE 2000 USING LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION EXTRACTED 70 LATENT TOPICS WHICH TWO SUBJECT EXPERTS INSPECTED FOR THEMES BASED ON REPRESENTATIVE TERMS. POSTERIOR ANALYSIS ASSESSED THE DISTRIBUTION OF TOPICS WITHIN POSTS, AND THE RANGE OF THEMES DISCUSSED ACROSS POSTS. RESULTS: LESS THAN 1% OF POSTS (N = 3998) CONTAINED SMOKING/CESSATION-RELATED TERMS, AND COVERED TOPICS RELATED TO CANCER DIAGNOSES, TREATMENTS, AND COPING. THE MOST FREQUENT SMOKING-RELATED TOPICS WERE QUIT SMOKING METHODS (5.4% OF POSTS), AND THE ENVIRONMENT FOR QUITTERS (2.9% OF POSTS), SUCH AS THE STIGMA ASSOCIATED WITH BEING A SMOKER DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER AND LACK OF EMPATHY EXPERIENCED COMPARED TO NONSMOKERS. SMOKING AS A RISK FACTOR FOR ONE'S DIAGNOSIS WAS A PRIMARY TOPIC IN ONLY 1.7% OF SMOKING/CESSATION-RELATED POSTS. CONCLUSIONS: THE LOW FREQUENCY OF SMOKING/CESSATION-RELATED POSTS MAY BE DUE TO EXPECTED CRITICISM/STIGMA FOR SMOKING BUT MAY ALSO SUGGESTS A NEED FOR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS TO ADDRESS SMOKING AND ASSIST WITH QUITTING IN THE DIAGNOSTIC AND TREATMENT PROCESS. TOPIC MODEL ANALYSIS REVEALED POTENTIAL BARRIERS THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED IN DEVISING CLINICAL OR POPULATION-LEVEL INTERVENTIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS WHO SMOKE. IMPLICATIONS: ALTHOUGH SMOKING IS A MAJOR RISK FACTOR FOR CANCER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT CANCER PATIENTS' OR SURVIVORS' VIEWS OR CONCERNS ABOUT SMOKING AND QUITTING. THIS STUDY USED TEXT MINING OF POSTS TO AN ONLINE COMMUNITY OF CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS TO INVESTIGATE CONTEXTS IN WHICH SMOKING OR QUITTING IS DISCUSSED. RESULTS INDICATED THAT SMOKING AND QUITTING DISCUSSIONS WERE RELATIVELY RARE, BUT NEVERTHELESS PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO BARRIERS THAT MAY NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IN CESSATION INTERVENTIONS FOR SURVIVORS.",1,1,1

TEXT MINING ANALYSIS CAN PREDICT WHETHER AN EMERGING FIELD WILL BECOME A LONG-LASTING SOURCE OF ACADEMIC INTEREST OR WHETHER IT IS SIMPLY A PASSING SOURCE OF INTEREST THAT WILL SOON DISAPPEAR. THE DATA WERE ANALYZED BY AGE GROUP (45 AND OLDER VS. 44 AND YOUNGER). THE HIGHEST RANKING FRAGMENTS IN THE ORDER OF FREQUENCY WERE: ""CARE"", ""DAUGHTER"", ""DISEASE"", ""FAMILY"", ""HIV"", ""HOSPITAL"", ""HUSBAND"", ""MEDICINES"", ""MONEY"", ""PEOPLE"", ""SON"", ""TELL/DISCLOSURE"", ""THOUGHT"", ""WANT"", AND ""YEARS"". PARTICIPANTS IN THE 44-YEAR-OLD AND YOUNGER GROUP WERE FOCUSED MAINLY ON DISEASE DISCLOSURE, THEIR FAMILIES, AND THEIR FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN OLDER PLWHA, SOCIAL SUPPORTS WERE ONE OF THE MAIN CONCERNS. IN THIS STUDY, WE LEARNED THAT DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS PERCEIVE THE DISEASE DIFFERENTLY. THEREFORE, WHEN DESIGNING INTERVENTION, RESEARCHERS SHOULD CONSIDER TO TAILOR AN INTERVENTION TO A SPECIFIC POPULATION AND TO HELP PLWHA ACHIEVE A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE. PROMOTING SELF-MANAGEMENT CAN BE AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY FOR EVERY ENCOUNTER WITH HIV-POSITIVE INDIVIDUALS.",1,1,1

OBJECTIVE: USING EATING DISORDER-RELATED (EDR) FORUMS AS AN EXAMPLE, THIS STUDY DETAILED A METHODOLOGY THAT AIMED TO DETERMINE SUBTYPES OF MENTAL HEALTH-RELATED FORUMS AND PROFILE THEIR COMMENTERS BASED ON THE OTHER FORUMS TO WHICH THEY CONTRIBUTED. METHODS: THE RESEARCHERS IDENTIFIED ALL PUBLIC EDR FORUMS (WITH 500 CONTRIBUTING COMMENTERS BETWEEN MARCH 2017 AND FEBRUARY 2018) ON A LARGE WEB-BASED DISCUSSION PLATFORM (REDDIT). A MIXED-METHODS APPROACH COMPRISING NETWORK ANALYSIS WITH COMMUNITY DETECTION, TEXT MINING, AND MANUAL REVIEW IDENTIFIED SUBTYPES OF EDR FORUMS. FOR EACH SUBTYPE, ANOTHER NETWORK ANALYSIS WITH COMMUNITY DETECTION WAS CONDUCTED USING THE EDR FORUM COMMENTER OVERLAP BETWEEN 50 FORUMS ON WHICH THE COMMENTERS ALSO COMMENTED. THE TOPICS OF FORUMS IN EACH DETECTED COMMUNITY WERE THEN MANUALLY REVIEWED TO IDENTIFY THE SHARED INTERESTS OF EACH SUBTYPE OF EDR FORUM COMMENTERS. RESULTS: SIX SUBTYPES OF EDR FORUMS WERE IDENTIFIED, TO WHICH 14,024 COMMENTERS HAD CONTRIBUTED. THE RESULTS FOCUS ON 2 SUBTYPES-PROEATING DISORDER AND THINSPIRATION-AND COMMUNITIES OF COMMENTERS WITHIN BOTH SUBTYPES. WITHIN THE PROEATING DISORDER SUBTYPE, 3 COMMUNITIES OF COMMENTERS WERE DETECTED THAT RELATED TO THE BODY AND EATING, MENTAL HEALTH, AND WOMEN, APPEARANCE, AND MIXED TOPICS.

OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO REFINE AN ADOLESCENT DEPRESSION ONTOLOGY AND TERMINOLOGY AS A FRAMEWORK FOR ANALYZING SOCIAL MEDIA DATA AND TO EVALUATE DESCRIPTION LOGICS BETWEEN CLASSES AND THE APPLICABILITY OF THIS ONTOLOGY TO SENTIMENT ANALYSIS. METHODS: THE DOMAIN AND SCOPE OF THE ONTOLOGY WERE DEFINED USING COMPETENCY QUESTIONS. THE CONCEPTS CONSTITUTING THE ONTOLOGY AND TERMINOLOGY WERE COLLECTED FROM CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES, THE LITERATURE, AND SOCIAL MEDIA POSTINGS ON ADOLESCENT DEPRESSION. CLASS CONCEPTS, THEIR HIERARCHY, AND THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG CLASS CONCEPTS WERE DEFINED. AN INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE ONTOLOGY WAS DESIGNED USING THE ENTITY-ATTRIBUTE-VALUE (EAV) TRIPLET DATA MODEL, AND SUPERCLASSES OF THE ONTOLOGY WERE ALIGNED WITH THE UPPER ONTOLOGY. DESCRIPTION LOGICS BETWEEN CLASSES WERE EVALUATED BY MAPPING CONCEPTS EXTRACTED FROM THE ANSWERS TO FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQS) ONTO THE ONTOLOGY CONCEPTS DERIVED FROM DESCRIPTION LOGIC QUERIES. THE APPLICABILITY OF THE ONTOLOGY WAS VALIDATED BY EXAMINING THE REPRESENTABILITY OF 1358 SENTIMENT PHRASES USING THE ONTOLOGY EAV MODEL AND CONDUCTING SENTIMENT ANALYSES OF SOCIAL MEDIA DATA USING ONTOLOGY CLASS CONCEPTS. RESULTS: WE DEVELOPED AN ADOLESCENT DEPRESSION ONTOLOGY THAT COMPRISED 443 CLASSES AND 60 RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE CLASSES; THE TERMINOLOGY COMPRISED 1682 SYNONYMS OF THE 443 CLASSES. IN THE DESCRIPTION LOGICS TEST, NO ERROR IN RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CLASSES WAS FOUND, AND ABOUT 89% (55/62) OF THE CONCEPTS CITED IN THE ANSWERS TO FAQS MAPPED ONTO THE ONTOLOGY CLASS. REGARDING APPLICABILITY, THE EAV TRIPLET MODELS OF THE ONTOLOGY CLASS REPRESENTED ABOUT 91.4% OF THE SENTIMENT PHRASES INCLUDED IN THE SENTIMENT DICTIONARY. IN THE SENTIMENT ANALYSES, ""ACADEMIC STRESSES"" AND ""SUICIDE"" CONTRIBUTED NEGATIVELY TO THE SENTIMENT OF ADOLESCENT DEPRESSION. CONCLUSIONS: THE ONTOLOGY AND TERMINOLOGY DEVELOPED IN THIS STUDY PROVIDE A SEMANTIC FOUNDATION FOR ANALYZING SOCIAL MEDIA DATA ON ADOLESCENT DEPRESSION.

THE MAIN QUESTIONS WERE AS FOLLOWS: WHICH ARE THE MAIN COMMUNITIES AND MOST INFLUENTIAL USERS?; WHERE ARE THE MAIN CONTENT PROVIDERS FROM?; WHAT ARE THE KEY BIOMEDICAL AND SCIENTIFIC TOPICS UNDER DISCUSSION? HOW ARE TOPICS INTERRELATED IN PATIENT COMMUNICATIONS?; HOW DO EXTERNAL EVENTS INFLUENCE USER ACTIVITY?; WHAT KIND OF EXTERNAL SOURCES OF INFORMATION ARE BEING PROMOTED? METHODS: TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS, A DATASET OF TWEETS CONTAINING TERMS RELATED TO BD CONDITIONS WAS COLLECTED FROM FEBRUARY TO AUGUST 2018, ACCOUNTING FOR A TOTAL OF 24,634 TWEETS FROM 13,295 DIFFERENT USERS. TWEET PREPROCESSING ENTAILED THE EXTRACTION OF TEXTUAL CONTENTS, HYPERLINKS, HASHTAGS, TIME, LOCATION, AND USER INFORMATION. MISSING AND INCOMPLETE INFORMATION ABOUT THE USER PROFILES WAS COMPLETED USING DIFFERENT ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES. SEMANTIC TWEET TOPIC ANALYSIS WAS SUPPORTED BY A LEXICON-BASED ENTITY RECOGNIZER. FURTHERMORE, SENTIMENT ANALYSIS ENABLED A CLOSER LOOK INTO THE OPINIONS EXPRESSED IN THE TWEETS, NAMELY, GAINING A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF PATIENTS' FEELINGS AND EXPERIENCES. RESULTS: HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS RECEIVED MOST OF THE COMMUNICATION, WHEREAS BD PATIENTS AND EXPERTS IN BOWEL CONDITIONS AND NUTRITION WERE AMONG THOSE TWEETING THE MOST. IN GENERAL, THE BD COMMUNITY WAS MAINLY DISCUSSING SYMPTOMS, BD-RELATED DISEASES, AND DIET-BASED TREATMENTS. DIARRHEA AND CONSTIPATION WERE THE MOST COMMONLY MENTIONED SYMPTOMS, AND CANCER, ANXIETY DISORDER, DEPRESSION, AND CHRONIC INFLAMMATIONS WERE FREQUENTLY PART OF BD-RELATED TWEETS. MOST PATIENT TWEETS DISCUSSED THE BAD SIDE OF BD CONDITIONS AND OTHER RELATED CONDITIONS, NAMELY, DEPRESSION, DIARRHEA, AND FIBROMYALGIA.

"663","E I, 2020, ","OBJECTIVE: MINING THE DATA CONTAINED WITHIN ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHRS) CAN POTENTIALLY GENERATE A GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF MEDICATION EFFECTS IN THE REAL WORLD, COMPLEMENTING WHAT WE KNOW FROM RANDOMISED CONTROL TRIALS (RCTS). WE PROPOSE A TEXT MINING APPROACH TO DETECT ADVERSE EVENTS AND MEDICATION EPISODES FROM THE CLINICAL TEXT TO ENHANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF ADVERSE EFFECTS RELATED TO CLOZAPINE, THE MOST EFFECTIVE ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUG FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF TREATMENT-RESISTANT SCHIZOPHRENIA, BUT UNDERUTILISED DUE TO CONCERNS OVER ITS SIDE EFFECTS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: WE USED DATA FROM DE-IDENTIFIED EHRS OF THREE MENTAL HEALTH TRUSTS IN THE UK (>50 MILLION DOCUMENTS, OVER 500,000 PATIENTS, 2835 OF WHICH WERE PRESCRIBED CLOZAPINE). WE EXPLORED THE PREVALENCE OF 33 ADVERSE EFFECTS BY AGE, GENDER, ETHNICITY, SMOKING STATUS AND ADMISSION TYPE THREE MONTHS BEFORE AND AFTER THE PATIENTS STARTED CLOZAPINE TREATMENT. WHERE POSSIBLE, WE COMPARED THE PREVALENCE OF ADVERSE EFFECTS WITH THOSE REPORTED IN THE SIDE EFFECTS RESOURCE (SIDER). RESULTS: SEDATION, FATIGUE, AGITATION, DIZZINESS, HYPERSALIVATION, WEIGHT GAIN, TACHYCARDIA, HEADACHE, CONSTIPATION AND CONFUSION WERE AMONGST THE HIGHEST RECORDED CLOZAPINE ADVERSE EFFECT IN THE THREE MONTHS FOLLOWING THE START OF TREATMENT. HIGHER PERCENTAGES OF ALL ADVERSE EFFECTS WERE FOUND IN THE FIRST MONTH OF CLOZAPINE THERAPY. USING A SIGNIFICANCE LEVEL OF (P< 0.05) OUR CHI-SQUARE TESTS SHOW A SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION BETWEEN MOST OF THE ADRS AND SMOKING STATUS AND HOSPITAL ADMISSION, AND SOME IN GENDER, ETHNICITY AND AGE GROUPS IN ALL TRUSTS HOSPITALS. LATER WE COMBINED THE DATA FROM THE THREE TRUSTS HOSPITALS TO ESTIMATE THE AVERAGE EFFECT OF ADRS IN EACH MONTHLY INTERVAL. IN GENDER AND ETHNICITY, THE RESULTS SHOW SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION IN 7 OUT OF 33 ADRS, SMOKING STATUS SHOWS SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION IN 21 OUT OF 33 ADRS AND HOSPITAL ADMISSION SHOWS THE SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION IN 30 OUT OF 33 ADRS. CONCLUSION: A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW DRUGS WORK IN THE REAL WORLD CAN COMPLEMENT CLINICAL TRIALS.",0,1,0

KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF THESE HEALTH BELIEFS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR EDUCATION PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS HEALTH PROMOTION AND ILLNESS PREVENTION. PURPOSE: THIS ANALYSIS DESCRIBES THE DIABETES EXPLANATORY MODELS OF ILLNESS (EMS) OF LOW-INCOME, RURAL, WHITE SOUTHERNERS WHO HAVE NOT BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH DIABETES. METHOD: IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH LOW-INCOME WHITE WOMEN (N = 19) AND MEN (N = 20) AGED 18 TO 54 YEARS WHO RESIDED IN A RURAL SOUTHERN TOWN. THE TAPE-RECORDED INTERVIEWS WERE COMPLETED BY TRAINED INTERVIEWERS AND WERE TRANSCRIBED VERBATIM. COMPUTER-ASSISTED TEXT ANALYSIS WAS USED, AND ALL TRANSCRIPTS WERE CODED BY 2 INVESTIGATORS. FINDINGS: ALTHOUGH ALL THE PARTICIPANTS HAD HEARD OF DIABETES, THEIR EMS WERE VAGUE AND UNDEVELOPED. WOMEN WERE MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE THAN MEN WERE. FAMILY AND HEREDITY WERE WIDELY BELIEVED TO BE CAUSES, WITH HEREDITY INCLUDING GENETIC AND LEARNED BEHAVIOR COMPONENTS. PARTICIPANTS DISAGREED ABOUT THE ROLE OF DIET AND WEIGHT IN CAUSING DIABETES; EXERCISE WAS NOT PERCEIVED AS RELATED TO CAUSATION. PARTICIPANTS HAD KNOWLEDGE OF THOSE SYMPTOMS, COMPLICATIONS, AND TREATMENTS THAT COULD BE OBSERVED. CONCLUSIONS: THESE RURAL, WHITE SOUTHERNERS DID NOT SHARE WELL-DEVELOPED EMS FOR DIABETES, WITH MOST HAVING A VAGUE AND INCOMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THIS DISEASE. THE DIABETES BELIEFS OF THESE RURAL SOUTHERNERS DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM CURRENT MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE.

THIS STUDY EXAMINES HOW E-CIGARETTES ARE ADDRESSED IN GLOBALINK, AN ONLINE INTERNATIONAL TOBACCO CONTROL COMMUNITY. WE SEEK TO DISCOVER IF THE PATTERN OF ACTIVITY IN E-CIGARETTE DISCUSSIONS CHANGES OVER TIME. WE ARE ALSO INTERESTED IN UNDERSTANDING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF SENTIMENT TOWARD E-CIGARETTES IN DISCUSSION TOPICS BETWEEN COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERENT NETWORK CHARACTERISTICS. DESIGN: NETWORK ANALYSIS TO EXPLORE THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MEMBERS FROM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, AND SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF MESSAGES AND THREADS TO IDENTIFY PATTERNS OF HOW DIFFERENT COUNTRIES ADDRESS E-CIGARETTE TOPICS. SETTING: GLOBALINK, AN ONLINE INTERNATIONAL TOBACCO CONTROL COMMUNITY. PARTICIPANTS: NETWORK ANALYSIS BASED ON GLOBALINK MEMBERS FROM 37 DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. SENTIMENT ANALYSIS BASED ON 853 POSTED MESSAGES, WITH OVER 1.4 MILLION WORDS. OUTCOME MEASURES: NETWORK CENTRALITY MEASURES IN COUNTRY INTERACTION DATA, INCLUDING DEGREE, CLOSENESS AND BETWEENNESS. SENTIMENT SCORES FOR EACH MESSAGE, AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN COUNTRY SCORES. RESULTS: THE NETWORK ANALYSIS FOUND A CORE/PERIPHERY STRUCTURE WHERE CENTRAL COUNTRIES FOCUSED ON ACTIVE POSITIVE DISCUSSIONS PERTAINING TO E-CIGARETTES, WHILE ISOLATED AND PERIPHERAL COUNTRIES POSTED NEGATIVE TOPICS WITHOUT MANY RESPONSES. A QUALITATIVE EXAMINATION OF MESSAGE TOPICS SUGGESTS THAT GENERAL SUBJECTS ELICIT MORE INTERACTIONS THAN THOSE THAT ARE CONTEXT SPECIFIC.

"667","J CA, 2018, ","INTRODUCTION: EXPLOITING INFORMATION IN HEALTH-RELATED SOCIAL MEDIA SERVICES IS OF GREAT INTEREST FOR PATIENTS, RESEARCHERS AND MEDICAL COMPANIES. THE CHALLENGE IS, HOWEVER, TO PROVIDE EASY, QUICK AND RELEVANT ACCESS TO THE VAST AMOUNT OF INFORMATION THAT IS AVAILABLE. ONE STEP TOWARDS FACILITATING INFORMATION ACCESS TO ONLINE HEALTH DATA IS OPINION MINING. EVEN THOUGH THE CLASSIFICATION OF PATIENT OPINIONS INTO POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY TACKLED, MOST WORKS MAKE USE OF MACHINE LEARNING METHODS AND BAGS OF WORDS. OUR FIRST CONTRIBUTION IS AN EXTENSIVE EVALUATION OF DIFFERENT FEATURES, INCLUDING LEXICAL, SYNTACTIC, SEMANTIC, NETWORK-BASED, SENTIMENT-BASED AND WORD EMBEDDINGS FEATURES TO REPRESENT PATIENT-AUTHORED TEXTS FOR POLARITY CLASSIFICATION. THE SECOND CONTRIBUTION OF THIS WORK IS THE STUDY OF POLAR FACTS (I.E. OBJECTIVE INFORMATION WITH POLAR CONNOTATIONS). TRADITIONALLY, THE PRESENCE OF POLAR FACTS HAS BEEN NEGLECTED AND RESEARCH IN POLARITY CLASSIFICATION HAS BEEN BOUNDED TO OPINIONATED TEXTS. WE DEMONSTRATE THE EXISTENCE AND IMPORTANCE OF POLAR FACTS FOR THE POLARITY CLASSIFICATION OF HEALTH INFORMATION. MATERIAL AND METHODS: WE ANNOTATE A SET OF MORE THAN 3500 POSTS TO ONLINE HEALTH FORUMS OF BREAST CANCER, CROHN AND DIFFERENT ALLERGIES, RESPECTIVELY. EACH SENTENCE IN A POST IS MANUALLY LABELED AS ""EXPERIENCE"", ""FACT"" OR ""OPINION"", AND AS ""POSITIVE"", ""NEGATIVE"" AND ""NEUTRAL"". USING THIS DATA, WE TRAIN DIFFERENT MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS AND COMPARE TRADITIONAL BAGS OF WORDS REPRESENTATIONS WITH WORD EMBEDDINGS IN COMBINATION WITH LEXICAL, SYNTACTIC, SEMANTIC, NETWORK-BASED AND EMOTIONAL PROPERTIES OF TEXTS TO AUTOMATICALLY CLASSIFY PATIENT-AUTHORED CONTENTS INTO POSITIVE, NEGATIVE AND NEUTRAL. BESIDE, WE EXPERIMENT WITH A COMBINATION OF TEXTUAL AND SEMANTIC REPRESENTATIONS BY GENERATING CONCEPT EMBEDDINGS USING THE UMLS METATHESAURUS. RESULTS: WE REACH TWO MAIN RESULTS: FIRST, WE FIND THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO PREDICT POLARITY OF PATIENT-AUTHORED CONTENTS WITH A VERY HIGH ACCURACY ( 70 PERCENT) USING WORD EMBEDDINGS, AND THAT THIS CONSIDERABLY OUTPERFORMS MORE TRADITIONAL REPRESENTATIONS LIKE BAGS OF WORDS; AND SECOND, WHEN DEALING WITH MEDICAL INFORMATION, NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE FACTS (I.E. OBJECTIVE INFORMATION) ARE NEARLY AS FREQUENT AS NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE OPINIONS AND EXPERIENCES (I.E. SUBJECTIVE INFORMATION), AND THEIR IMPORTANCE FOR POLARITY CLASSIFICATION IS CRUCIAL.",0,1,1

HOWEVER, ALTHOUGH PREVIOUS APPROACHES USING OPINION MINING ONLY HAVE CLASSIFIED VARIOUS NEEDS OF USERS INTO POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE CATEGORIES, THEY CANNOT DERIVE THE MAIN REASONS FOR THEIR OPINION. TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM, THIS RESEARCH PROPOSES AN APPROACH TO EXPLORING TECHNOLOGY OPPORTUNITY BY STRUCTURING USER NEEDS WITH A CONCEPT OF OPINION TRIGGER OF OBJECTS AND FUNCTIONS OF THE TECHNOLOGY-BASED PRODUCTS. TO DISCOVER TECHNOLOGY OPPORTUNITY, FIRST, AN OPINION TRIGGER IS IDENTIFIED FROM REVIEW DATA USING NAVE BASE CLASSIFIER AND NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING.

THEREFORE, IT IS NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND THE DEMANDS AND GAINS OF HEALTH CARE STAKEHOLDERS IN HCP-PATIENT ONLINE INTERACTIONS AND DETERMINE AN AGENDA FOR FUTURE WORK. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMS TO PRESENT A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE ANTECEDENTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF HCP-PATIENT ONLINE INTERACTIONS. IT SEEKS TO REACH A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHY HCPS AND PATIENTS ARE WILLING TO INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER ONLINE AND WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF HCP-PATIENT ONLINE INTERACTIONS ARE FOR HEALTH CARE STAKEHOLDERS. BASED ON THIS, WE INTEND TO IDENTIFY THE GAPS IN EXISTING STUDIES AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH. METHODS: IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRISMA (PREFERRED REPORTING ITEMS FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND META-ANALYSES) GUIDELINES, A SYSTEMATIC RETRIEVAL WAS CARRIED OUT FROM THE WEB OF SCIENCE, PUBMED, AND SCOPUS ELECTRONIC DATABASES. THE SEARCH RESULTS WERE CONFINED TO THOSE PAPERS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH BETWEEN JANUARY 1, 2000 AND JUNE 30, 2018. SELECTED STUDIES WERE THEN EVALUATED FOR QUALITY; STUDIES THAT DID NOT MEET QUALITY CRITERIA WERE EXCLUDED FROM FURTHER ANALYSIS. FINDINGS OF THE REVIEWED STUDIES RELATED TO OUR RESEARCH QUESTIONS WERE EXTRACTED AND SYNTHESIZED THROUGH INDUCTIVE THEMATIC ANALYSIS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 8440 RECORDS WERE FOUND AFTER THE INITIAL SEARCH, 28 PAPERS OF WHICH WERE SELECTED FOR ANALYSIS. ACCESSIBILITY TO HCPS, SELF-MANAGEMENT, AND UNMET NEEDS WERE THE MAIN TRIGGERS FOR PATIENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN ONLINE INTERACTION. FOR HCPS, PATIENT EDUCATION, CAREER NEEDS, AND SELF-PROMOTION WERE THE MAJOR REASONS WHY THEY TOOK THE ONLINE APPROACH. THERE WERE SEVERAL ASPECTS OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF HCP-PATIENT ONLINE INTERACTIONS ON HEALTH CARE STAKEHOLDERS. CONSEQUENCES FOR PATIENTS INCLUDED PATIENT EMPOWERMENT, HEALTH PROMOTION, AND ACQUISITION OF UNCERTAIN ANSWERS. CONSEQUENCES FOR HCPS INCLUDED SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC RETURNS, LACK OF CONTROL OVER THEIR ROLE, AND GAINING MORE APPOINTMENTS. HCP-PATIENT ONLINE INTERACTIONS ALSO IMPROVED COMMUNICATION EFFICIENCY IN OFFLINE SETTINGS AND HELPED MANAGERS OF ONLINE HEALTH CARE SETTINGS GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF PATIENTS' NEEDS. HEALTH CARE STAKEHOLDERS HAVE ALSO ENCOUNTERED ETHICAL AND LEGAL ISSUES DURING ONLINE INTERACTION. CONCLUSIONS: THROUGH A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW, WE SOUGHT OUT THE ANTECEDENTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF HCP-PATIENT ONLINE INTERACTIONS TO UNDERSTAND THE TRIGGERS FOR HCPS AND PATIENTS TO PARTICIPATE AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF PARTICIPATING. POTENTIAL FUTURE RESEARCH TOPICS ARE THE INFLUENCES ON THE CHAIN OF ONLINE INTERACTION, SPECIFICATIONS AND PRINCIPLES OF PRIVACY DESIGN WITHIN ONLINE HEALTH CARE SETTINGS, AND ROLES THAT SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS PLAY.

METHOD ONLINE REVIEWS OF 21 POPULAR PSAPS WERE COLLECTED FROM THE AMAZON.COM WEBSITE. THE REVIEWS FOR EACH PRODUCT WERE EXPORTED TO COMPILE INDIVIDUAL PRODUCT-SPECIFIC TEXT FILES. A SENTIMENT MINING ANALYSIS WAS COMPLETED TO AGGREGATE THE NUMBER OF POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE COMMENTS FOR EACH PRODUCT. IN ADDITION, THE EFFECT OF VALUE FOR MONEY, AVAILABLE FEATURES, PERCEIVED BENEFIT, AND OVERALL PERCEPTION OF PSAPS WAS EVALUATED. A CORRELATIONAL ANALYSIS WAS COMPLETED TO EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DIFFERENT PSAP FEATURES AND THE NUMBER OF POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE COMMENTS. RESULTS MIXED-MODEL ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE SHOWED A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NUMBER OF POSITIVE COMMENTS FOR HIGH- AND MID-COST PRODUCTS IN TERMS OF OVERALL PERCEPTION AND PERCEIVED BENEFIT COMPARED TO LOW-COST PRODUCTS. FOR FEATURE ATTRIBUTE, HIGH-COST PRODUCTS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER POSITIVE COMMENTS COMPARED TO MID- AND LOW-COST PRODUCTS. THERE WAS A STRONG CORRELATION BETWEEN PRICE AND POSITIVE COMMENTS AND A MODERATE CORRELATION BETWEEN PRICE AND NEGATIVE COMMENTS. ALSO, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT MODERATE CORRELATION BETWEEN PRESENCE OF COMPRESSION AND FEEDBACK SUPPRESSION PSAP FEATURES AND POSITIVE COMMENTS. CONCLUSIONS POSITIVE SENTIMENTS EXPRESSED TOWARD PSAPS WERE FOUND TO FAVOR HIGH- AND MID-LEVEL PRODUCTS. HOWEVER, THERE WAS A CONSIDERABLY HIGH NUMBER OF NEGATIVE SENTIMENTS REPORTED ACROSS ALL THE PSAPS INVESTIGATED. THE NOTICEABLE THING IS THAT THE NEGATIVE COMMENTS DO NOT CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY ACROSS PRICE RANGES. HOWEVER, THE POSITIVE COMMENTS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE WITH AN INCREASE IN PRODUCT PRICE RANGE. THIS INDICATES A POSSIBLE INCREASE IN BENEFIT WITH HIGH-COST PRODUCTS. HOWEVER, THIS CLAIM REQUIRES FURTHER EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE THROUGH CONTROLLED STUDIES.",0,1,1

ON AUGUST 25, 2016, THE FORMER SURGEON GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES SENT AN OPEN LETTER TO CARE PROVIDERS ASKING FOR THEIR HELP WITH COMBATTING THIS GROWING HEALTH CRISIS. SOCIAL MEDIA FORUMS LIKE TWITTER ALLOW FOR OPEN DISCUSSIONS AMONG THE PUBLIC AND UP-TO-DATE EXCHANGES OF INFORMATION ABOUT TIMELY TOPICS LIKE OPIOIDS. THEREFORE, THE GOAL OF THE CURRENT STUDY IS TO IDENTIFY THE PUBLIC'S REACTIONS TO THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC BY IDENTIFYING THE MOST POPULAR TOPICS TWEETED BY USERS. METHODS: WE USED A TEXT-MINER, ALGORITHMIC-DRIVEN STATISTICAL PROGRAM TO CAPTURE 73,235 ORIGINAL TWEETS AND RETWEETS POSTED WITHIN A TWO-MONTH TIME SPAN (AUGUST 15, 2016 THROUGH OCTOBER 15, 2016). ALL TWEETS CONTAINED REFERENCES TO ""OPIOIDS,"" ""TURNTHETIDE,"" OR SIMILAR KEYWORDS. WE THEN ANALYZED THE SETS OF TWEETS TO IDENTIFY THE MOST PREVALENT TOPICS.

INVESTIGATING THE ORIGINS, RISK FACTORS, AND RESPONSES RELATED TO THIS OUTBREAK IS CRITICAL TO INFORM FUTURE SURVEILLANCE, INTERVENTIONS, AND POLICYMAKING. IN RESPONSE, THIS RETROSPECTIVE INFOVEILLANCE STUDY IDENTIFIES AND CHARACTERIZES USER-GENERATED MESSAGES RELATED TO OPIOID ABUSE, HEROIN INJECTION DRUG USE, AND HIV STATUS USING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) AMONG TWITTER USERS IN INDIANA DURING THE PERIOD OF THIS HIV OUTBREAK. MATERIALS AND METHODS: OUR STUDY CONSISTED OF TWO PHASES: DATA COLLECTION AND PROCESSING, AND DATA ANALYSIS. WE COLLECTED INDIANA GEOLOCATED TWEETS FROM THE PUBLIC TWITTER API USING AMAZON WEB SERVICES EC2 INSTANCES FILTERED FOR GEOCODED MESSAGES IN THE IMMEDIATE PRE AND POST PERIOD OF THE OUTBREAK. IN THE DATA ANALYSIS PHASE WE APPLIED AN UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH USING NLP CALLED THE BITERM TOPIC MODEL (BTM) TO IDENTIFY TWEETS RELATED TO OPIOID, HEROIN/INJECTION, AND HIV BEHAVIOR AND THEN EXAMINED THESE MESSAGES FOR HIV RISK-RELATED TOPICS THAT COULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE OUTBREAK. RESULTS: MORE THAN 10 MILLION GEOCODED TWEETS OCCURRING IN INDIANA DURING THE IMMEDIATE PRE AND POST PERIOD OF THE OUTBREAK WERE COLLECTED FOR ANALYSIS. USING BTM, WE IDENTIFIED 1350 TWEETS THOUGHT TO BE RELEVANT TO THE OUTBREAK AND THEN CONFIRMED 358 TWEETS USING HUMAN ANNOTATION. THE MOST PREVALENT THEMES IDENTIFIED WERE TWEETS RELATED TO SELF-REPORTED ABUSE OF ILLICIT AND PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, OPIOID USE DISORDER, SELF-REPORTED HIV STATUS, AND PUBLIC SENTIMENT REGARDING THE OUTBREAK. GEOSPATIAL ANALYSIS FOUND THAT THESE MESSAGES CLUSTERED IN POPULATION DENSE AREAS OUTSIDE OF THE OUTBREAK, INCLUDING INDIANAPOLIS AND NEIGHBORING CLARK COUNTY. DISCUSSION: THIS INFOVEILLANCE STUDY CHARACTERIZED THE SOCIAL MEDIA CONVERSATIONS OF COMMUNITIES IN INDIANA IN THE PRE AND POST PERIOD OF THE 2015 HIV OUTBREAK. BEHAVIORAL THEMES DETECTED REFLECT DISCUSSION ABOUT RISK FACTORS RELATED TO HIV TRANSMISSION STEMMING FROM OPIOID AND HEROIN ABUSE FOR PRIORITY POPULATIONS, AND ALSO HELP IDENTIFY COMMUNITY ATTITUDES THAT COULD HAVE MOTIVATED OR DETRACTED THE USE OF HIV PREVENTION METHODS, ALONG WITH HELPING IDENTIFY FACTORS THAT CAN IMPEDE ACCESS TO PREVENTION SERVICES.

SELF-DISCLOSURE ABOUT NEGATIVE EMOTIONS (BETA=.24, P<.001), NEGATIVE EVENTS (BETA=.25, P<.001), AND POSITIVE EVENTS (BETA=.10, P=.02) INCREASED EMOTIONAL SUPPORT. HOWEVER, ASKING QUESTIONS DEPRESSED EMOTIONAL SUPPORT (BETA=-.21, P<.001). IN CONTRAST, ASKING QUESTIONS INCREASED INFORMATIONAL SUPPORT (BETA=.38, P<.001), WHEREAS POSITIVE INFORMATIONAL SELF-DISCLOSURE DEPRESSED IT (BETA=-.09, P=.003). SELF-DISCLOSURE LED TO THE PERCEPTION OF EMOTIONAL NEEDS, WHICH ELICITED EMOTIONAL SUPPORT, WHEREAS ASKING QUESTIONS LED TO THE PERCEPTION OF INFORMATIONAL NEEDS, WHICH ELICITED INFORMATIONAL SUPPORT. PART 2 USED MACHINE-CODED DATA TO REPLICATE THESE RESULTS. PART 3 ANALYZED THE MACHINE-CODED DATA AND SHOWED THAT EXPOSURE TO MORE EMOTIONAL SUPPORT PREDICTED STAYING IN THE GROUP LONGER 33% (HAZARD RATIO=0.67, P<.001), WHEREAS EXPOSURE TO MORE INFORMATIONAL SUPPORT PREDICTED LEAVING THE GROUP SOONER (HAZARD RATIO=1.05, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: SELF-DISCLOSURE IS EFFECTIVE IN ELICITING EMOTIONAL SUPPORT, WHEREAS QUESTION ASKING IS EFFECTIVE IN ELICITING INFORMATIONAL SUPPORT. MOREOVER, PERCEPTIONS THAT PEOPLE DESIRE PARTICULAR KINDS OF SUPPORT INFLUENCE THE SUPPORT THEY RECEIVE. FINALLY, THE TYPE OF SUPPORT PEOPLE RECEIVE AFFECTS THE LIKELIHOOD OF THEIR STAYING IN OR LEAVING THE GROUP.

WE FURTHER DESCRIBED THE HOT TOPIC KEYWORDS AND SENTIMENT TRENDS OF PUBLIC ATTENTION. WE USED VOSVIEWER TO IMPLEMENT A VISUAL CLUSTER ANALYSIS OF HOT KEYWORDS AND BUILD A SOCIAL NETWORK OF PUBLIC OPINION CONTENT. RESULTS: THE STUDY HAS FOUR MAIN FINDINGS. FIRST, WE ANALYZED THE CHANGING TREND OF THE PUBLIC'S ATTENTION TO THE COVID-19 EPIDEMIC, WHICH CAN BE DIVIDED INTO THREE STAGES. SECOND, THE HOT TOPIC KEYWORDS OF PUBLIC ATTENTION AT EACH STAGE WERE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT. THIRD, THE EMOTIONAL TENDENCY OF THE PUBLIC TOWARD THE COVID-19 EPIDEMIC-RELATED HOT TOPICS CHANGED FROM NEGATIVE TO NEUTRAL, WITH NEGATIVE EMOTIONS WEAKENING AND POSITIVE EMOTIONS INCREASING AS A WHOLE. FOURTH, WE DIVIDED THE COVID-19 TOPICS WITH THE MOST PUBLIC CONCERN INTO FIVE CATEGORIES: THE SITUATION OF THE NEW CASES OF COVID-19 AND ITS IMPACT, FRONTLINE REPORTING OF THE EPIDEMIC AND THE MEASURES OF PREVENTION AND CONTROL, EXPERT INTERPRETATION AND DISCUSSION ON THE SOURCE OF INFECTION, MEDICAL SERVICES ON THE FRONTLINE OF THE EPIDEMIC, AND FOCUS ON THE WORLDWIDE EPIDEMIC AND THE SEARCH FOR SUSPECTED CASES.

THE MEDIAN EFFECTIVE DOSE OF PE WAS FOUR SESSIONS. ALTHOUGH SOME COVARIATES WERE FOUND TO BE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT PREDICTORS OF CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL IMPROVEMENT (E.G., AGE, GENDER, PTSD MEDICATIONS, AND DEPRESSIVE DISORDER COMORBIDITY), THESE EFFECTS WERE SMALL. CLINICIANS AND PATIENTS SHOULD CONSIDER EVALUATING TREATMENT RESPONSE AFTER FOUR SESSIONS TO DETERMINE PRELIMINARY EFFECTIVENESS OF PE.",1,1,1
"717","S C, 2017, ","FROM MAY TO JULY 2015, THERE WAS A NATION-WIDE OUTBREAK OF MIDDLE EAST RESPIRATORY SYNDROME (MERS) IN KOREA.

DESPITE EXPERT OPINIONS THAT THE DANGER OF MERS MIGHT BE EXAGGERATED, THERE WAS AN OVERREACTION BY THE PUBLIC ACCORDING TO THE KOREAN MASS MEDIA, WHICH LED TO A NOTICEABLE REDUCTION IN SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES DURING THE OUTBREAK. TO EXPLAIN THIS PHENOMENON, WE PRESUMED THAT MACHINE LEARNING-BASED ANALYSIS OF MEDIA OUTLETS WOULD BE HELPFUL AND COLLECTED A NUMBER OF KOREAN MASS MEDIA ARTICLES AND SHORT-TEXT COMMENTS PRODUCED DURING THE 10-WEEK OUTBREAK. TO PROCESS AND ANALYZE THE COLLECTED DATA (OVER 86 MILLION WORDS IN TOTAL) EFFECTIVELY, WE CREATED A METHODOLOGY COMPOSED OF MACHINE-LEARNING AND INFORMATION-THEORETIC APPROACHES. OUR PROPOSAL INCLUDED TECHNIQUES FOR EXTRACTING EMOTIONS FROM EMOTICONS AND INTERNET SLANG, WHICH ALLOWED US TO SIGNIFICANTLY (APPROXIMATELY 73%) INCREASE THE NUMBER OF EMOTION-BEARING TEXTS NEEDED FOR ROBUST SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF SOCIAL MEDIA.

WE USED DATA COLLECTED AS PART OF ROUTINE CLINICAL CARE TO STUDY WHITE MATTER INTEGRITY OF THE BRAIN'S LIMBIC SYSTEM AND ITS ASSOCIATION TO TREATMENT RESPONSE. METHODS: ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS OF MULTIPLE LARGE NEW ENGLAND HOSPITALS WERE SCREENED FOR PATIENTS WITH AN MDD BILLING DIAGNOSIS, AND NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING WAS SUBSEQUENTLY APPLIED TO FIND THOSE WITH CONCURRENT DIFFUSION-WEIGHTED IMAGES, BUT WITHOUT ANY DIAGNOSED BRAIN PATHOLOGY. TREATMENT OUTCOME WAS DETERMINED BY REVIEW OF CLINICAL CHARTS. MDD PATIENTS (N = 29 NON-REMITTERS, N = 26 PARTIAL-REMITTERS, AND N = 37 FULL-REMITTERS), AND HEALTHY CONTROL SUBJECTS (N = 58) WERE ANALYZED FOR FRACTIONAL ANISOTROPY (FA) OF THE FORNIX AND CINGULUM BUNDLE. RESULTS: FAILURE TO ACHIEVE REMISSION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER FA AMONG MDD PATIENTS, STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT FOR THE MEDIAL BODY OF THE FORNIX. MOREOVER, GLOBAL AND REGIONAL-SELECTIVE AGE-RELATED FA DECLINE WAS MOST PRONOUNCED IN PATIENTS WITH TREATMENT-REFRACTORY, NON-REMITTED DEPRESSION.

HOWEVER, MOST OF THE PREVIOUS WORK IN THIS AREA HAS FOCUSED ON USER-GENERATED CONTENT, THAT IS, CONTENT CREATED BY THE INDIVIDUAL, SUCH AS AN INDIVIDUAL'S POSTS AND PICTURES. IN THIS STUDY, WE EXPLORED THE PREDICTIVE CAPABILITY OF COMMUNITY-GENERATED CONTENT, THAT IS, THE DATA GENERATED BY A COMMUNITY OF FRIENDS OR FOLLOWERS, RATHER THAN BY A SOLE INDIVIDUAL, TO IDENTIFY DEPRESSION AMONG SOCIAL MEDIA USERS. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH WAS TO EVALUATE THE UTILITY OF COMMUNITY-GENERATED CONTENT ON SOCIAL MEDIA, SUCH AS COMMENTS ON AN INDIVIDUAL'S POSTS, TO PREDICT DEPRESSION AS DEFINED BY THE CLINICALLY VALIDATED PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE-8 (PHQ-8) ASSESSMENT QUESTIONNAIRE. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE RESULTS OF THIS RESEARCH MAY PROVIDE NEW INSIGHTS INTO NEXT GENERATION OF POPULATION-LEVEL MENTAL ILLNESS RISK ASSESSMENT AND INTERVENTION DELIVERY. METHODS: WE CREATED A WEB-BASED SURVEY ON A CROWDSOURCING PLATFORM THROUGH WHICH PARTICIPANTS GRANTED ACCESS TO THEIR INSTAGRAM PROFILES AS WELL AS PROVIDED THEIR RESPONSES TO PHQ-8 AS A REFERENCE STANDARD FOR DEPRESSION STATUS. AFTER DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE AND POSTPROCESSING, THE STUDY ANALYZED THE DATA OF 749 PARTICIPANTS. TO BUILD OUR PREDICTIVE MODEL, LINGUISTIC FEATURES WERE EXTRACTED FROM INSTAGRAM POST CAPTIONS AND COMMENTS, INCLUDING MULTIPLE SENTIMENT SCORES, EMOJI SENTIMENT ANALYSIS RESULTS, AND META-VARIABLES SUCH AS THE NUMBER OF LIKES AND AVERAGE COMMENT LENGTH. IN THIS STUDY, 10.4% (78/749) OF THE DATA WERE HELD OUT AS A TEST SET. THE REMAINING 89.6% (671/749) OF THE DATA WERE USED TO TRAIN AN ELASTIC-NET REGULARIZED LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL TO PREDICT PHQ-8 SCORES. WE COMPARED DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THIS MODEL (IE, A MODEL TRAINED ON ONLY USER-GENERATED DATA, A MODEL TRAINED ON ONLY COMMUNITY-GENERATED DATA, AND A MODEL TRAINED ON THE COMBINATION OF BOTH TYPES OF DATA) ON A TEST SET TO EXPLORE THE UTILITY OF COMMUNITY-GENERATED DATA IN OUR PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS. RESULTS: THE 2 MODELS, THE FIRST TRAINED ON ONLY COMMUNITY-GENERATED DATA (AREA UNDER CURVE [AUC]=0.71) AND THE SECOND TRAINED ON A COMBINATION OF USER-GENERATED AND COMMUNITY-GENERATED DATA (AUC=0.72), HAD STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT PERFORMANCES FOR PREDICTING DEPRESSION BASED ON THE MANN-WHITNEY U TEST (P=.03 AND P=.02, RESPECTIVELY).

OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMS TO DEVELOP A MODEL TO AUTOMATICALLY RECOGNIZE HOTSPOTS BASED ON TEXT AND SPEECH FEATURES, WHICH MIGHT BE AN EFFICIENT WAY TO TRACK PATIENT PROGRESS AND PREDICT TREATMENT EFFICACY. METHOD: A MULTIMODAL SUPERVISED CLASSIFICATION MODEL WAS DEVELOPED BASED ON ANALOG TAPE RECORDINGS AND TRANSCRIPTS OF IMAGINAL EXPOSURE SESSIONS OF 10 SUCCESSFUL AND 10 NON-SUCCESSFUL TREATMENT COMPLETERS. DATA MINING AND MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES WERE USED TO EXTRACT AND SELECT TEXT (E.G. WORDS AND WORD COMBINATIONS) AND SPEECH (E.G. SPEECH RATE, PAUSES BETWEEN WORDS) FEATURES THAT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN 'HOTSPOT' (N = 37) AND 'NON-HOTSPOT' (N = 45) PHASES DURING EXPOSURE SESSIONS. RESULTS: THE DEVELOPED MODEL RESULTED IN A HIGH TRAINING PERFORMANCE (MEAN F (1)-SCORE OF 0.76) BUT A LOW TESTING PERFORMANCE (MEAN F (1)-SCORE = 0.52). THIS SHOWS THAT THE SELECTED TEXT AND SPEECH FEATURES COULD CLEARLY DISTINGUISH BETWEEN HOTSPOTS AND NON-HOTSPOTS IN THE CURRENT DATA SET, BUT WILL PROBABLY NOT RECOGNIZE HOTSPOTS FROM NEW INPUT DATA VERY WELL. CONCLUSIONS: IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE RECOGNITION OF NEW HOTSPOTS, THE DESCRIBED METHODOLOGY SHOULD BE APPLIED TO A LARGER, HIGHER QUALITY (DIGITALLY RECORDED) DATA SET.

"738","E M, 2020, ","INTRODUCTION: PHYSICAL DISTANCING DURING THE CORONAVIRUS COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS BROUGHT TELEHEALTH TO THE FOREFRONT TO KEEP UP WITH PATIENT CARE AMIDST AN INTERNATIONAL CRISIS THAT IS EXHAUSTING HEALTHCARE RESOURCES. UNDERSTANDING AND MANAGING HEALTH-RELATED CONCERNS RESULTING FROM PHYSICAL DISTANCING MEASURES ARE OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE. OBJECTIVES: TO DESCRIBE AND ANALYZE THE VOLUME, CONTENT, AND GEOSPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF TWEETS ASSOCIATED WITH TELEHEALTH DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. METHODS: WE INQUIRED TWITTER PUBLIC DATA TO ACCESS TWEETS RELATED TO TELEHEALTH FROM MARCH 30, 2020 TO APRIL 6, 2020. WE ANALYZED TWEETS USING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) AND UNSUPERVISED LEARNING METHODS. CLUSTERING ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED TO CLASSIFY TWEETS. GEOGRAPHIC TWEET DISTRIBUTION WAS CORRELATED WITH COVID-19 CONFIRMED CASES IN THE UNITED STATES. ALL ANALYSES WERE CARRIED ON THE GOOGLE CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICE ""GOOGLE COLAB"" USING PYTHON LIBRARIES (PYTHON SOFTWARE FOUNDATION). RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 41,329 TWEETS CONTAINING THE TERM ""TELEHEALTH"" WERE RETRIEVED. THE MOST COMMON TERMS APPEARING ALONGSIDE 'TELEHEALTH' WERE ""COVID"", ""HEALTH"", ""CARE"", ""SERVICES"", ""PATIENTS"", AND ""PANDEMIC"". MENTAL HEALTH WAS THE MOST COMMON HEALTH-RELATED TOPIC THAT APPEARED IN OUR SEARCH REFLECTING A HIGH NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTHCARE DURING THE PANDEMIC. SIMILARLY, MEDICARE WAS THE MOST COMMON APPEARING HEALTH PLAN MIRRORING THE ACCELERATED ACCESS TO TELEHEALTH AND CHANGE IN COVERAGE POLICIES. THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF TWEETS RELATED TO TELEHEALTH AND HAVING A SPECIFIC LOCATION WITHIN THE UNITED STATES (N=19,367) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE NUMBER OF CONFIRMED COVID-19 CASES REPORTED IN EACH STATE (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: SOCIAL MEDIA ACTIVITY IS AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF DISEASE BURDEN DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. WIDESPREAD ADOPTION OF TELEHEALTH-FAVORING POLICIES IS NECESSARY AND MOSTLY NEEDED TO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS THAT MAY ARISE IN AREAS OF HIGH INFECTION AND DEATH RATES.",0,1,0

COMMUNICABLE DISEASE REPORTING RELATED TO FOREIGN-BORN PERSONS HAS NOT YET BEEN EVALUATED. OBJECTIVE: EXAMINE HOW POLITICAL LEANING IN THE MEDIA AFFECTS REPORTING ON TUBERCULOSIS (TB) IN FOREIGN-BORN PERSONS. METHODS: HEALTHMAP, A DIGITAL SURVEILLANCE PLATFORM THAT AGGREGATES NEWS SOURCES ON GLOBAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES, WAS USED. DATA WAS QUERIED FOR MEDIA REPORTS FROM THE U.S. BETWEEN 2011-2019, CONTAINING THE TERM ""TB"" OR ""TUBERCULOSIS"" AND ""FOREIGN BORN"", ""REFUGEE (S),"" OR ""IM (MIGRANTS)."" REPORTS WERE REVIEWED TO EXCLUDE DUPLICATES AND NON-HUMAN CASES. EACH MEDIA SOURCE WAS RATED USING TWO INDEPENDENT MEDIA BIAS INDICATORS TO ASSESS POLITICAL LEANING. FORTY-SIX NON-TUBERCULOSIS REPORTS WERE RANDOMLY SAMPLED AND EVALUATED AS A CONTROL. TWO INDEPENDENT REVIEWERS PERFORMED SENTIMENT ANALYSIS ON EACH REPORT. RESULTS: OF 891 TB-ASSOCIATED REPORTS IN THE US, 46 REFERENCED FOREIGN-BORN INDIVIDUALS, AND WERE INCLUDED IN THIS ANALYSIS. 60.9% (28) OF REPORTS WERE PUBLISHED IN RIGHT-LEANING NEWS MEDIA AND 6.5% (3) OF REPORTS IN LEFT-LEANING MEDIA, WHILE 39.1% (18) OF THE CONTROL GROUP REPORTS WERE PUBLISHED IN LEFT- LEANING MEDIA AND 10.9% (5) IN RIGHT-LEANING MEDIA (P < .001). 43% (20) OF ALL STUDY REPORTS WERE POSTED IN 2016. SENTIMENT ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT RIGHT-LEANING REPORTS OFTEN PORTRAYED FOREIGN-BORN PERSONS NEGATIVELY. CONCLUSION: PRELIMINARY DATA FROM THIS PILOT SUGGEST THAT POLITICAL LEANING MAY AFFECT REPORTING ON TB IN US FOREIGN-BORN POPULATIONS. RIGHT-LEANING NEWS ORGANIZATIONS PRODUCED THE MOST REPORTS ON TB, AND THE MAJORITY OF THESE REPORTS PORTRAYED FOREIGN-BORN PERSONS NEGATIVELY. IN ADDITION, THE CONTROL GROUP COMPRISED OF NON-TB, NON-FOREIGN BORN REPORTS ON COMMUNICABLE DISEASES FEATURED A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF LEFT-LEANING NEWS OUTLETS, SUGGESTING THAT REPORTING ON TB IN FOREIGN-BORN INDIVIDUALS MAY BE OF GREATER INTEREST TO RIGHT-LEANING OUTLETS.

"740","L P, 2020, ","BACKGROUND: GIFT GIVING, WHICH HAS BEEN A HEAVILY DEBATED TOPIC IN HEALTH CARE FOR MANY YEARS, IS CONSIDERED AS A WAY OF EXPRESSING GRATITUDE AND TO BE BENEFICIAL FOR THE PHYSICIAN-PATIENT RELATIONSHIP WITHIN A REASONABLE RANGE. HOWEVER, NOT MUCH WORK HAS BEEN DONE TO EXAMINE THE INFLUENCE OF GIFT GIVING ON PHYSICIANS' SERVICE QUALITY, ESPECIALLY IN THE ONLINE HEALTH CARE ENVIRONMENT. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY ADDRESSED THE CONSEQUENCES OF GIFT GIVING BY MINING AND ANALYZING THE DYNAMIC PHYSICIAN-PATIENT INTERACTION PROCESSES IN AN ONLINE HEALTH COMMUNITY. SPECIFICALLY, GIFT TYPES (AFFECTIVE OR INSTRUMENTAL) BASED ON THE MOTIVATIONS AND PHYSICIAN-PATIENT TIE STRENGTH WERE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED TO ACCOUNT FOR DIFFERENCES IN PHYSICIANS' SERVICE QUALITY. METHODS: THE DYNAMIC INTERACTION PROCESSES (INVOLVING 3154 GIFTS) BETWEEN 267 PHYSICIANS AND 14,187 PATIENTS FROM A WELL-KNOWN ONLINE HEALTH COMMUNITY IN CHINA (HAODF.COM) WERE ANALYZED TO OBTAIN EMPIRICAL RESULTS. RESULTS: OUR RESULTS REVEAL THAT PATIENT GIFT GIVING INSPIRES PHYSICIANS TO IMPROVE THEIR SERVICE QUALITY AS MEASURED BY PHYSICIANS' MORE DETAILED RESPONSES AND IMPROVED BEDSIDE MANNER, AND THE DEGREE OF INFLUENCE VARIED ACCORDING TO THE STRENGTH OF THE PHYSICIAN-PATIENT TIE. MOREOVER, AFFECTIVE GIFTS AND INSTRUMENTAL GIFTS HAD DIFFERENT EFFECTS IN IMPROVING PHYSICIANS' SERVICE QUALITY ONLINE. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY IS AMONG THE FIRST TO EXPLORE GIFT GIVING IN ONLINE HEALTH COMMUNITIES PROVIDING BOTH IMPORTANT THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL CONTRIBUTIONS.

OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY PROPOSES SEMANTIC SIMILARITY OF THE PATIENT'S AND PHYSICIAN'S LANGUAGE IN A MEDICAL INTERACTION AS A MEASURE OF PATIENT-PHYSICIAN COMMUNICATION. LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS (LSA), A MATHEMATICAL METHOD FOR MODELING SEMANTIC MEANING, WAS EMPLOYED TO ASSESS SIMILARITY IN LANGUAGE DURING CLINICAL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PHYSICIANS AND PATIENTS. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE 132 BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN PATIENTS (76% WOMEN, MAGE = 43.8, RANGE = 18-82) WHO PARTICIPATED IN CLINICAL INTERACTIONS WITH 17 PHYSICIANS (53% WOMEN, MAGE = 27.1, RANGE = 26-35) IN A PRIMARY CARE CLINIC IN A LARGE CITY IN THE MIDWESTERN UNITED STATES. RESULTS: LSA CAPTURED RELIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT PATIENT-PHYSICIAN COMMUNICATION: THE MEAN CORRELATION INDICATING SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE TRANSCRIPTS OF A PHYSICIAN AND PATIENT IN A CLINICAL INTERACTION WAS 0.142, SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN ZERO; THE MEAN CORRELATION BETWEEN A PATIENT'S TRANSCRIPT AND TRANSCRIPTS OF THEIR PHYSICIAN DURING INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER PATIENTS WAS NOT DIFFERENT FROM ZERO. PHYSICIANS DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE SEMANTIC SIMILARITY BETWEEN THEIR LANGUAGE AND THAT OF THEIR PATIENTS, AND THESE DIFFERENCES WERE RELATED TO PHYSICIAN ETHNICITY AND GENDER. FEMALE PATIENTS EXHIBITED GREATER COMMUNICATION SIMILARITY WITH THEIR PHYSICIANS THAN DID MALE PATIENTS. FINALLY, GREATER COMMUNICATION SIMILARITY WAS PREDICTED BY LESS PATIENT TRUST IN PHYSICIANS PRIOR TO THE INTERACTION AND GREATER PATIENT TRUST AFTER THE INTERACTION. CONCLUSION: LSA IS A POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT TOOL IN PATIENT-PHYSICIAN COMMUNICATION RESEARCH. METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN APPLYING LSA TO ADDRESS RESEARCH QUESTIONS IN PATIENT-PHYSICIAN COMMUNICATION ARE DISCUSSED.",0,1,1

WE ANALYSED DISCUSSIONS ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS REGARDING DMARDS TO UNDERSTAND THE COLLECTIVE SENTIMENT EXPRESSED TOWARDS THESE MEDICATIONS. METHODS: TREATO ANALYTICS WERE USED TO DOWNLOAD ALL AVAILABLE POSTS ON SOCIAL MEDIA ABOUT DMARDS IN THE CONTEXT OF RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. STRICT FILTERS ENSURED THAT USER GENERATED CONTENT WAS DOWNLOADED. THE SENTIMENT (POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE) EXPRESSED IN THESE POSTS WAS ANALYSED FOR EACH DMARD USING SENTIMENT ANALYSIS. WE ALSO ANALYSED THE REASON(S) FOR THIS SENTIMENT FOR EACH DMARD, LOOKING SPECIFICALLY AT EFFICACY AND SIDE EFFECTS. RESULTS: COMPUTER ALGORITHMS ANALYSED MILLIONS OF SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS AND INCLUDED 54 742 POSTS ABOUT DMARDS. WE FOUND THAT BOTH CLASSES HAD AN OVERALL POSITIVE SENTIMENT. THE RATIO OF POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE POSTS WAS HIGHER FOR B/TSDMARDS (1.210) THAN FOR CSDMARDS (1.048). EFFICACY WAS THE MOST COMMONLY MENTIONED REASON IN POSTS WITH A POSITIVE SENTIMENT AND LACK OF EFFICACY WAS THE MOST COMMONLY MENTIONED REASON FOR A NEGATIVE SENTIMENT. THESE WERE FOLLOWED BY THE PRESENCE/ABSENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS IN NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE POSTS, RESPECTIVELY. CONCLUSIONS: PUBLIC OPINION ON SOCIAL MEDIA IS GENERALLY POSITIVE ABOUT DMARDS.

IN THE BUSINESS LITERATURE, SENGE'S THEORY OF ADAPTIVE LEARNING ORGANISATIONS OFFERS A MODEL OF ORGANISATIONAL QUALITY. HOWEVER, WHILE ACCREDITATION OF NATIONAL STANDARDS IS AN INCREASING MECHANISM FOR ACHIEVING QUALITY IN AGED CARE, THERE ARE ANECDOTAL CONCERNS IT CREATES A 'MINIMUM STANDARDS COMPLIANCE MENTALITY' AND NO EVIDENCE ABOUT WHETHER IT REINFORCES LEARNING ORGANISATIONS. OBJECTIVE: THE RESEARCH QUESTION WAS 'DO MANDATORY NATIONAL ACCREDITATION STANDARDS FOR RESIDENTIAL AGED CARE, AS THEY ARE WRITTEN, POSITIVELY MODEL LEARNING ORGANISATIONS?'. METHOD: AUTOMATIC TEXT ANALYSIS WAS COMBINED WITH CRITICAL DISCOURSE ANALYSIS TO ANALYSE THE PRESENCE OF LEARNING CONCEPTS FROM SENGE'S LEARNING ORGANISATION THEORY IN AN EXHAUSTIVE SAMPLE OF NATIONAL ACCREDITATION STANDARDS FROM 7 COUNTRIES. THE TWO STAGES OF ANALYSIS WERE: (1) QUANTITATIVE MAPPING OF THE PRESENCE OF LEARNING ORGANISATION CONCEPTS IN STANDARDS USING BAYESIAN-BASED TEXTUAL ANALYTICS SOFTWARE AND (2) QUALITATIVE CRITICAL DISCOURSE ANALYSIS TO FURTHER EXAMINE HOW THE LANGUAGE OF STANDARDS SO IDENTIFIED MAY BE MODELLING LEARNING ORGANISATION CONCEPTS. RESULTS: THE LEARNING CONCEPTS 'TRAINING', 'DEVELOPMENT', 'KNOWLEDGE', AND 'SYSTEMS' ARE PRESENT WITH RELATIVE FREQUENCIES OF 19%, 11%, 10%, AND 10% RESPECTIVELY IN THE 1944 INSTANCES, IN PARAGRAPH-SIZED TEXT BLOCKS, CONSIDERED. CONCEPTS SUCH AS 'TEAM', 'INTEGRATION', 'LEARNING', 'CHANGE' AND 'INNOVATION' OCCUR WITH 7%, 6%, 5%, 5%, AND 1% RELATIVE FREQUENCIES RESPECTIVELY. LEARNING CONCEPTS TEND TO CO-OCCUR WITH NEGATIVE RATHER THAN POSITIVE SENTIMENT LANGUAGE IN THE 3176 INSTANCES IN TEXT BLOCKS CONTAINING SENTIMENT LANGUAGE. CRITICAL DISCOURSE ANALYSIS SUGGESTED THAT STANDARDS GENERALLY USE THE LANGUAGE OF ORGANISATIONAL CHANGE AND LEARNING IN LIMITED WAYS THAT APPEAR TO MODEL 'LEARNING AVERSE' COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE AND ORGANISATIONAL CULTURES. CONCLUSION: THE AGED CARE QUALITY CHALLENGE AND THE ROLE OF STANDARDS NEED RETHINKING. ALL STANDARDS IMPLICITLY OR EXPLICITLY MODEL AN ORGANISATION OF SOME TYPE. IF STANDARDS CAN MODEL A LIMITED AND NEGATIVE LEARNING ORGANISATION LANGUAGE, THEY COULD MODEL A WELL-DEVELOPED AND POSITIVE LEARNING ORGANISATION LANGUAGE. IN THE CONTEXT OF THE GLOBAL AGED CARE CRISIS, THE MODELLING OF LEARNING ORGANISATIONS IS PROBABLY CRITICAL FOR MINIMAL COMPETENCE IN RESIDENTIAL AGED CARE AND CERTAINLY ACHIEVABLE IN THE LANGUAGE OF STANDARDS.",0,1,1

OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY IS AIMED AT DEVELOPING AND EVALUATING DEEP LEARNING-BASED TEXT CLASSIFICATION MODELS FOR CLASSIFYING SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT POSTED DURING THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK, USING THE FOUR KEY CONSTRUCTS OF THE HBM. WE WILL SPECIFICALLY FOCUS ON CONTENT RELATED TO THE PHYSICAL DISTANCING INTERVENTIONS PUT FORTH BY PUBLIC HEALTH AUTHORITIES. WE INTEND TO TEST THE MODEL WITH A REAL-WORLD CASE STUDY. METHODS: THE DATA SET FOR THIS STUDY WAS PREPARED BY ANALYZING FACEBOOK COMMENTS THAT WERE POSTED BY THE PUBLIC IN RESPONSE TO THE COVID-19-RELATED POSTS OF THREE PUBLIC HEALTH AUTHORITIES: THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH OF SINGAPORE (MOH), THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, AND PUBLIC HEALTH ENGLAND. THE COMMENTS MADE IN THE CONTEXT OF PHYSICAL DISTANCING WERE MANUALLY CLASSIFIED WITH A YES/NO FLAG FOR EACH OF THE FOUR HBM CONSTRUCTS: PERCEIVED SEVERITY, PERCEIVED SUSCEPTIBILITY, PERCEIVED BARRIERS, AND PERCEIVED BENEFITS. USING A CURATED DATA SET OF 16,752 COMMENTS, GATED RECURRENT UNIT-BASED RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK MODELS WERE TRAINED AND VALIDATED FOR TEXT CLASSIFICATION. ACCURACY AND BINARY CROSS-ENTROPY LOSS WERE USED TO EVALUATE THE MODEL. SPECIFICITY, SENSITIVITY, AND BALANCED ACCURACY WERE USED TO EVALUATE THE CLASSIFICATION RESULTS IN THE MOH CASE STUDY. RESULTS: THE HBM TEXT CLASSIFICATION MODELS ACHIEVED MEAN ACCURACY RATES OF 0.92, 0.95, 0.91, AND 0.94 FOR THE CONSTRUCTS OF PERCEIVED SUSCEPTIBILITY, PERCEIVED SEVERITY, PERCEIVED BENEFITS, AND PERCEIVED BARRIERS, RESPECTIVELY.

THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION RECENTLY ENCOURAGED THE USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA AS A TOOL TO GAIN INSIGHT ON PATIENTS' PERSPECTIVES REGARDING SYMPTOMS EXPERIENCED AND THE IMPACTS OF THEIR DISEASE. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMED TO USE DISEASE-SPECIFIC SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS BY PATIENTS WITH AML OR MDS WHO ARE INELIGIBLE FOR INTENSIVE CHEMOTHERAPY AND THEIR CAREGIVERS TO CAPTURE FACTORS THEY FEEL ARE MOST IMPORTANT, AND TO PROVIDE CURRENT EVIDENCE TO INFORM AND CHARACTERIZE THESE PERSPECTIVES. METHODS: POSTS BY PATIENTS WITH AML OR MDS AND THEIR CAREGIVERS WERE EXTRACTED FROM PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DISCUSSIONS ON 3 LARGE AML- OR MDS-SPECIFIC SITES. THESE POSTS WERE MANUALLY REVIEWED TO ONLY INCLUDE PATIENTS WHO ARE INELIGIBLE FOR INTENSIVE CHEMOTHERAPY. A TOTAL OF 1443 POSTS FROM 220 AML PATIENTS/CAREGIVERS AND 2733 POSTS FROM 127 MDS PATIENTS/CAREGIVERS MET THE STUDY INCLUSION CRITERIA. A QUALITATIVE DATA ANALYSIS (QDA) OF A SAMPLE OF 85 PATIENTS'/CAREGIVERS' POSTS WAS CONDUCTED TO IDENTIFY THEMES, AND A TARGETED QDA OF POSTS FROM 79 USERS FOCUSED ON TREATMENT DECISION DISCUSSIONS. POSTS WERE MANUALLY REVIEWED, AND RELEVANT TEXT SEGMENTS WERE CODED AND GROUPED INTO CATEGORIES AND OVERALL THEMES. RESULTS: EIGHTY-SIX PERCENT (73/85) OF USERS IN THE OVERALL QDA HAD RELEVANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE KEY OBJECTIVES. THE MOST COMMONLY DISCUSSED TREATMENT EXPERIENCE THEME WAS THE HUMANISTIC BURDEN OF AML OR MDS IN TERMS OF EMOTIONAL/PHYSICAL IMPACT AND IMPACT ON FAMILY (86%, 63/73 OF USERS), FOLLOWED BY TREATMENT DECISIONS (56%, 41/73) AND UNMET NEEDS (50%, 37/73). IN THE QDA OF TREATMENT DECISIONS, 60 POSTS FROM 45 USERS CONTAINED RELEVANT INFORMATION. PATIENTS COMMONLY REPORTED THE DESIRE TO REACH SPECIFIC MILESTONES, INCLUDING BIRTHDAYS AND WEDDINGS. THEY WISHED FOR A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE OVER QUANTITY OF LIFE, DID NOT WANT THE RISK OF SUFFERING FROM SIDE EFFECTS, AND EXPRESSED A CLEAR PREFERENCE TO BE AT HOME RATHER THAN IN A HOSPITAL OR CARE HOME. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY WAS A NOVEL APPLICATION OF DISEASE-SPECIFIC SOCIAL MEDIA. IT HIGHLIGHTED EXPERIENCES IN THE CURRENT TREATMENT OF AML AND MDS, INCLUDING INFORMATION GAPS, PATIENT/CAREGIVER UNCERTAINTY, AND THE IMPORTANCE OF UNDERSTANDING PATIENTS'/CAREGIVERS' GOALS AND OPINIONS. A CLEAR FINDING FROM THIS RESEARCH WAS THE IMPORTANCE OF REACHING CERTAIN PERSONAL LIFE GOALS AND BEING AT HOME WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS. THE ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT PATIENTS/CAREGIVERS FACE ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES, INCLUDING HUMANISTIC IMPACTS AND A LACK OF INFORMATION REGARDING TREATMENT OPTIONS.",1,1,0
"755","KE L, 2020, ","IMPORTANCE: IDENTIFICATION OF SUBGROUPS AT GREATEST RISK FOR SUICIDE MORTALITY IS ESSENTIAL FOR PREVENTION EFFORTS AND TARGETING INTERVENTIONS. SEXUAL MINORITY INDIVIDUALS MAY HAVE AN INCREASED RISK FOR SUICIDE COMPARED WITH HETEROSEXUAL INDIVIDUALS, BUT A LACK OF SUFFICIENTLY POWERED STUDIES WITH RIGOROUS METHODS FOR DETERMINING SEXUAL ORIENTATION HAS LIMITED THE KNOWLEDGE ON THIS POTENTIAL HEALTH DISPARITY. OBJECTIVE: TO INVESTIGATE SUICIDE MORTALITY AMONG SEXUAL MINORITY VETERANS USING VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (VHA) ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD DATA. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: THIS RETROSPECTIVE POPULATION-BASED COHORT STUDY USED DATA ON 8.1 MILLION US VETERANS ENROLLED IN THE VHA AFTER FISCAL YEAR 1999 THAT WERE OBTAINED FROM VHA ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS FROM OCTOBER 1, 1999 TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2017. DATA ANALYSIS WAS CARRIED OUT FROM MARCH 1, 2020 TO OCTOBER 31, 2020. EXPOSURE: VETERANS WITH DOCUMENTATION OF A MINORITY SEXUAL ORIENTATION. DOCUMENTATION OF SEXUAL MINORITY STATUS WAS OBTAINED THROUGH NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING OF CLINICAL NOTES AND EXTRACTION OF STRUCTURED ADMINISTRATIVE DATA FOR SEXUAL ORIENTATION IN VHA ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: SUICIDE MORTALITY RATE USING DATA ON THE UNDERLYING CAUSE OF DEATH OBTAINED FROM THE NATIONAL DEATH INDEX. CRUDE AND AGE-ADJUSTED MORTALITY RATES WERE CALCULATED FOR ALL-CAUSE DEATH AND DEATH FROM SUICIDE AMONG SEXUAL MINORITY VETERANS COMPARED WITH THE GENERAL US POPULATION AND THE GENERAL POPULATION OF VETERANS. RESULTS: AMONG THE 96 893 VETERANS WITH AT LEAST 1 SEXUAL MINORITY DOCUMENTATION IN THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD, THE MEAN (SD) AGE WAS 46 (16) YEARS, 68% WERE MALE, AND 70% WERE WHITE. OF THE 12 591 TOTAL DEATHS, 3.5% WERE FROM SUICIDE. VETERANS HAD A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER RATE OF MORTALITY FROM SUICIDE (STANDARDIZED MORTALITY RATIO, 4.50; 95% CI, 4.13-4.99) COMPARED WITH THE GENERAL US POPULATION. SUICIDE WAS THE FIFTH LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN 2017 AMONG SEXUAL MINORITY VETERANS (3.8% OF DEATHS) AND THE TENTH LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN THE GENERAL US POPULATION (1.7% OF DEATHS). THE CRUDE SUICIDE RATE AMONG SEXUAL MINORITY VETERANS (82.5 PER 100 000 PERSON-YEARS) WAS HIGHER THAN THE RATE IN THE GENERAL VETERAN POPULATION (37.7 PER 100 000 PERSON-YEARS). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: THE RESULTS OF THIS POPULATION-BASED COHORT STUDY SUGGEST THAT SEXUAL MINORITY VETERANS HAVE A GREATER RISK FOR SUICIDE THAN THE GENERAL US POPULATION AND THE GENERAL VETERAN POPULATION. FURTHER RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO DETERMINE WHETHER AND HOW SUICIDE PREVENTION EFFORTS REACH SEXUAL MINORITY VETERANS.",0,1,0

MOST OF THE PUBLISHED DATA ON INFERTILITY AND THE INTERNET ONLY ADDRESS THE EXPERIENCES OF WOMEN, WITH LIMITED STUDIES FOCUSING EXCLUSIVELY ON INTERNET DISCUSSIONS ON MALE FACTOR INFERTILITY. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS AND EXPERIENCES OF DISCUSSANTS ON AN ONLINE MALE INFERTILITY COMMUNITY AND TO PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF INTERACTIONS WITH HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. METHODS: USING THE LARGE-SCALE DATA ANALYTICS TOOL BIGQUERY, WE EXTRACTED ALL POSTS IN THE R/MALEINFERTILITY COMMUNITY (877 MEMBERS) OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITE AND DISCUSSION BOARD REDDIT FROM NOVEMBER 2017 TO OCTOBER 2018. WE PERFORMED A QUALITATIVE THEMATIC ANALYSIS AND QUANTITATIVE SEMANTIC ANALYSIS USING LANGUAGE INQUIRY AND WORD COUNT 2015 OF THE EXTRACTED POSTS TO IDENTIFY DOMINANT THEMES AND SUBTHEMES OF DISCUSSIONS. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS AND SEMANTIC ANALYTIC Z-SCORES WERE COMPUTED. RESULTS: FROM THE ANALYSIS OF 97 POSTS, NOTABLE THEMES AND SUBTHEMES EMERGED: 70 (72%) POSTS SHARED PERSONAL EXPERIENCES, INCLUDING FEELING EMASCULATED OR ISOLATED OR DESCRIBING A NEGATIVE (28/97, 29%), POSITIVE (13/97, 13%), OR NEUTRAL (56/97, 58%) EXPERIENCE WITH A HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL; 19% (18/97) OF THE POSTS POSED QUESTIONS ABOUT PERSONAL SEMEN ANALYSIS RESULTS. ON THE BASIS OF SEMANTIC ANALYSIS, POSTS BY MEN HAD HIGHER AUTHENTICITY SCORES (Z=3.44; P<.001), SUGGESTING MORE HONEST OR PERSONAL TEXTS, BUT LOWER CLOUT SCORES (Z=4.57; P<.001), SUGGESTING A MORE TENTATIVE OR ANXIOUS STYLE OF WRITING, COMPARED WITH POSTS BY WOMEN. CONCLUSIONS: TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, THIS STUDY REPRESENTS THE FIRST EVALUATION OF A SOCIAL MEDIA COMMUNITY FOCUSED EXCLUSIVELY ON MALE INFERTILITY USING MIXED METHODOLOGY.

"758","R BP, 2019, ","BACKGROUND: NONADHERENCE AMONG PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC DISEASE CONTINUES TO BE A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN, AND THE USE OF TEXT MESSAGE REFILL REMINDERS HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING ADHERENCE. HOWEVER, QUESTIONS REMAIN ABOUT HOW DIFFERENCES IN PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS AND DEMOGRAPHICS MIGHT INFLUENCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF REFILL USING THIS CHANNEL. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF AN SMS-BASED REFILL REMINDER SOLUTION USING CONVERSATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI; AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM THAT MIMICS HUMAN CONVERSATIONS) WITH A LARGE MEDICARE PATIENT POPULATION AND TO EXPLORE THE ASSOCIATION AND IMPACT OF PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS (AGE, GENDER, RACE/ETHNICITY, LANGUAGE) AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH ON SUCCESSFUL ENGAGEMENT WITH THE SOLUTION TO IMPROVE REFILL ADHERENCE. METHODS: THE STUDY TARGETED 99,217 PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC DISEASE, MEDIAN AGE OF 71 YEARS, FOR MEDICATION REFILL USING THE MPULSE MOBILE INTERACTIVE SMS TEXT MESSAGING SOLUTION FROM DECEMBER 2016 TO FEBRUARY 2019. ALL PATIENTS WERE PARTIALLY ADHERENT OR NONADHERENT MEDICARE PART D MEMBERS OF KAISER PERMANENTE, SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, A LARGE INTEGRATED HEALTH PLAN. PATIENTS RECEIVED SMS REMINDERS IN ENGLISH OR SPANISH AND USED SIMPLE NUMERIC OR TEXT RESPONSES TO VALIDATE THEIR IDENTITY, VIEW THEIR MEDICATION, AND COMPLETE A REFILL REQUEST. THE REFILL REQUESTS WERE PROCESSED BY KAISER PERMANENTE PHARMACISTS AND SUPPORT STAFF, AND REFILLS WERE PICKED UP AT THE PHARMACY OR MAILED TO PATIENTS. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS AND PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS WERE USED TO EXAMINE THE PATIENT POPULATION AND THEIR REFILL BEHAVIOR. QUALITATIVE TEXT ANALYSIS WAS USED TO EVALUATE QUALITY OF CONVERSATIONAL AI. RESULTS: OVER THE COURSE OF THE STUDY, 273,356 REFILL REMINDERS REQUESTS WERE SENT TO 99,217 PATIENTS, RESULTING IN 47,552 REFILL REQUESTS (17.40%). THIS WAS CONSISTENT WITH EARLIER PILOT STUDY FINDINGS. OF THOSE WHO REQUESTED A REFILL, 54.81% (26,062/47,552) DID SO WITHIN 2 HOURS OF THE REMINDER. THERE WAS A STRONG INVERSE RELATIONSHIP (R10=-0.93) BETWEEN SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND REFILL REQUESTS. SPANISH SPEAKERS (5149/48,156, 10.69%) HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER REFILL REQUEST RATES COMPARED WITH ENGLISH SPEAKERS (42,389/225,060, 18.83%; X(2)(1) [N=273,216]=1829.2; P<.001). THERE WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT RATES OF REFILL REQUESTS BY AGE BAND (X(2)(6) [N=268,793]=1460.3; P<.001), WITH YOUNGER PATIENTS REQUESTING REFILLS AT A HIGHER RATE. FINALLY, THE VAST MAJORITY (284,598/307,484, 92.23%) OF PATIENT RESPONSES WERE HANDLED USING CONVERSATIONAL AI. CONCLUSIONS: MULTIPLE FACTORS IMPACTED REFILL REQUEST RATES, INCLUDING A STRONG ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND REFILL RATES. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT HIGHER REFILL REQUESTS ARE LINKED TO LANGUAGE, RACE/ETHNICITY, AGE, AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH, AND THAT ENGLISH SPEAKERS, WHITES, THOSE YOUNGER THAN 75 YEARS, AND THOSE WITH LOWER SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH BARRIERS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO REQUEST A REFILL VIA SMS.

THE RAPID INCREASE OF ONLINE COMMUNITIES, OF WHICH MEMBERS INTERACT WITH OTHERS VIA THE INTERNET, HAVE GENERATED LARGE AMOUNTS OF DATA, OFFERING NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNDERSTANDING HIDDEN POPULATIONS WITH UNPRECEDENTED SAMPLE SIZES AND RICHNESS OF INFORMATION. IN THIS STUDY, WE TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF A HIDDEN POPULATION BY ANALYZING THE MASSIVE DATA GENERATED IN THE ONLINE COMMUNITY. METHODS: BY ELABORATELY DESIGNING CRAWLERS, WE RETRIEVED A COMPLETE DATASET FROM THE ""HIV BAR,"" THE LARGEST BAR RELATED TO HIV ON THE BAIDU TIEBA PLATFORM, FOR ALL RECORDS FROM JANUARY 2005 TO AUGUST 2016. THROUGH NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING AND SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS, WE EXPLORED THE PSYCHOLOGY, BEHAVIOR AND DEMAND OF ONLINE HIV POPULATION AND EXAMINED THE NETWORK COMMUNITY STRUCTURE. RESULTS: IN HIV COMMUNITIES, THE AVERAGE TOPIC SIMILARITY AMONG MEMBERS IS POSITIVELY CORRELATED TO NETWORK EFFICIENCY (R = 0.70, P < 0.001), INDICATING THAT THE CLOSER THE SOCIAL DISTANCE BETWEEN MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, THE MORE SIMILAR THEIR TOPICS. THE PROPORTION OF NEGATIVE USERS IN EACH COMMUNITY IS AROUND 60%, WEAKLY CORRELATED WITH COMMUNITY SIZE (R = 0.25, P = 0.002). IT IS FOUND THAT USERS SUSPECTING INITIAL HIV INFECTION OR FIRST IN CONTACT WITH HIGH-RISK BEHAVIORS TEND TO SEEK HELP AND ADVICE ON THE SOCIAL NETWORKING PLATFORM, RATHER THAN IMMEDIATELY GOING TO A HOSPITAL FOR BLOOD TESTS. CONCLUSIONS: ONLINE COMMUNITIES HAVE GENERATED COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF DATA OFFERING NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNDERSTANDING HIDDEN POPULATIONS WITH UNPRECEDENTED SAMPLE SIZES AND RICHNESS OF INFORMATION.

THIS STUDY DESCRIBED PATIENT EXPERIENCES REPORTED ONLINE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE DAY-TO-DAY DISEASE BURDEN OF ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS (AS). METHODS: UNGUIDED, ENGLISH-LANGUAGE PATIENT NARRATIVES REPORTED BETWEEN JANUARY 2010 AND MAY 2016 WERE COLLECTED FROM 52 ONLINE SOURCES (E.G., GENERAL/HEALTH SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES, PATIENT-PHYSICIAN Q&A SITES, AS FORUMS). USING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING COMBINED WITH MANUAL CURATION, PATIENT-REPORTED EXPERIENCES WITHIN NARRATIVES WERE EVALUATED AND CATEGORIZED INTO SOCIAL, PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL, COGNITIVE, AND ROLE ACTIVITY (SPEC-R) CONCEPTS TO ASSESS FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENT. THE SAME SPEC-R CATEGORIZATION WAS APPLIED TO 5 AS-SPECIFIC PRO INSTRUMENTS TO EVALUATE THEIR COVERAGE OF CONCEPTS EXTRACTED FROM PATIENT NARRATIVES. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 34,780 NARRATIVES FROM 3449 PATIENTS WITH AS WERE INCLUDED. PHYSICAL ASPECTS OF AS (E.G., PAIN AND MOBILITY) WERE MOST COMMONLY REPORTED BY PATIENTS (86.7%), FOLLOWED BY EMOTIONAL (32.5%), COGNITIVE (23.6%), ROLE ACTIVITY (8.7%) AND SOCIAL (5.1%).

METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH OF ARTICLES PUBLISHED IN PUBMED USING A PREDEFINED SET OF QUERIES THAT IDENTIFIED 99 POTENTIAL ARTICLES FOR REVIEW. THESE ARTICLES WERE SCREENED ACCORDING TO TOPIC RELEVANCE AND 14 WERE SELECTED FOR CONSIDERATION AS BEST PAPER CANDIDATES. THE 14 PAPERS WERE THEN PRESENTED TO A PANEL OF INTERNATIONAL EXPERTS FOR FULL PAPER REVIEW AND SCORING. THREE PAPERS THAT RECEIVED THE HIGHEST SCORE WERE DISCUSSED IN A CONSENSUS MEETING AND WERE AGREED UPON AS BEST PAPERS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN HEALTH FOR PATIENTS AND CONSUMERS IN THE YEAR 2018. RESULTS: ONLY A SMALL NUMBER OF 2018 PAPERS REPORTED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) RESEARCH FOR PATIENTS AND CONSUMERS. NO STUDIES WERE FOUND ON AI APPLICATIONS DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR PATIENTS OR CONSUMERS, NOR WERE THERE STUDIES THAT ELICITED PATIENT AND CONSUMER INPUT ON AI. CURRENTLY, THE MOST COMMON USE OF AI FOR PATIENTS AND CONSUMERS LIES IN SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF SOCIAL MEDIA DATA (E.G., ONLINE DISCUSSION FORUMS).

THESE AUTOMATIC SOLUTIONS WILL HELP REDUCE THE NEED FOR MANUAL ANALYSIS OF CONTENT. MOST PREVIOUS LITERATURE HAS CAST THE HATE SPEECH DETECTION PROBLEM AS A SUPERVISED TEXT CLASSIFICATION TASK USING CLASSICAL MACHINE LEARNING METHODS OR, MORE RECENTLY, DEEP LEARNING METHODS. HOWEVER, WORK INVESTIGATING THIS PROBLEM IN ARABIC CYBERSPACE IS STILL LIMITED COMPARED TO THE PUBLISHED WORK ON ENGLISH TEXT. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMS TO IDENTIFY HATE SPEECH RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC POSTED BY TWITTER USERS IN THE ARAB REGION AND TO DISCOVER THE MAIN ISSUES DISCUSSED IN TWEETS CONTAINING HATE SPEECH. METHODS: WE USED THE ARCOV-19 DATASET, AN ONGOING COLLECTION OF ARABIC TWEETS RELATED TO COVID-19, STARTING FROM JANUARY 27, 2020. TWEETS WERE ANALYZED FOR HATE SPEECH USING A PRETRAINED CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) MODEL; EACH TWEET WAS GIVEN A SCORE BETWEEN 0 AND 1, WITH 1 BEING THE MOST HATEFUL TEXT. WE ALSO USED NONNEGATIVE MATRIX FACTORIZATION TO DISCOVER THE MAIN ISSUES AND TOPICS DISCUSSED IN HATE TWEETS. RESULTS: THE ANALYSIS OF HATE SPEECH IN TWITTER DATA IN THE ARAB REGION IDENTIFIED THAT THE NUMBER OF NON-HATE TWEETS GREATLY EXCEEDED THE NUMBER OF HATE TWEETS, WHERE THE PERCENTAGE OF HATE TWEETS AMONG COVID-19 RELATED TWEETS WAS 3.2% (11,743/547,554). THE ANALYSIS ALSO REVEALED THAT THE MAJORITY OF HATE TWEETS (8385/11,743, 71.4%) CONTAINED A LOW LEVEL OF HATE BASED ON THE SCORE PROVIDED BY THE CNN. THIS STUDY IDENTIFIED SAUDI ARABIA AS THE ARAB COUNTRY FROM WHICH THE MOST COVID-19 HATE TWEETS ORIGINATED DURING THE PANDEMIC. FURTHERMORE, WE SHOWED THAT THE LARGEST NUMBER OF HATE TWEETS APPEARED DURING THE TIME PERIOD OF MARCH 1-30, 2020, REPRESENTING 51.9% OF ALL HATE TWEETS (6095/11,743). CONTRARY TO WHAT WAS ANTICIPATED, IN THE ARAB REGION, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE SPREAD OF COVID-19-RELATED HATE SPEECH ON TWITTER WAS WEAKLY RELATED WITH THE DISSEMINATION OF THE PANDEMIC BASED ON THE PEARSON CORRELATION COEFFICIENT (R=0.1982, P=.50). THE STUDY ALSO IDENTIFIED THE COMMONLY DISCUSSED TOPICS IN HATE TWEETS DURING THE PANDEMIC. ANALYSIS OF THE 7 EXTRACTED TOPICS SHOWED THAT 6 OF THE 7 IDENTIFIED TOPICS WERE RELATED TO HATE SPEECH AGAINST CHINA AND IRAN. ARAB USERS ALSO DISCUSSED TOPICS RELATED TO POLITICAL CONFLICTS IN THE ARAB REGION DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. CONCLUSIONS: THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC POSES SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH CHALLENGES TO NATIONS WORLDWIDE. DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, FREQUENT USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE SPREAD OF HATE SPEECH. HATE SPEECH ON THE WEB CAN HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON SOCIETY, AND HATE SPEECH MAY HAVE A DIRECT CORRELATION WITH REAL HATE CRIMES, WHICH INCREASES THE THREAT ASSOCIATED WITH BEING TARGETED BY HATE SPEECH AND ABUSIVE LANGUAGE.

METHODS: IN APRIL 2019, WE DOWNLOADED GLIOMA-RELATED PUBLICATIONS INDEXED IN PUBMED BETWEEN 1994 AND 2018. WE USED PYTHON TO EXTRACT THE TITLE, PUBLICATION DATE, MESH TERMS, AND ABSTRACT FROM THE METADATA OF EACH PUBLICATION FOR BIBLIOMETRIC ASSESSMENT. LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION (LDA) WAS APPLIED TO THE ABSTRACTS TO IDENTIFY PUBLICATIONS' RESEARCH TOPICS WITH GREATER SPECIFICITY. RESULTS: WE IDENTIFIED AND ANALYZED A TOTAL OF 52,625 PUBLICATIONS IN OUR STUDY. WE FOUND THAT RESEARCH ON PROGNOSIS AND THE TREATMENT OF GLIOBLASTOMA INCREASED THE MOST IN TERMS OF VOLUME AND RATE OF PUBLICATIONS OVER THE PAST 25 YEARS. HOWEVER, PUBLICATIONS REGARDING CLINICAL TRIALS ACCOUNTED FOR <5% OF ALL PUBLICATIONS CONSIDERED IN THIS STUDY. THE CURRENT RESEARCH LANDSCAPE COVERS CLINICAL, PRE-CLINICAL, BIOLOGICAL, AND TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF GLIOBLASTOMA; AT PRESENT, RESEARCHERS APPEAR TO BE LESS CONCERNED WITH GLIOBLASTOMA'S PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OR PATIENTS' END-OF-LIFE CARE.

OF THE LYNCH SYNDROME-RELATED TWEETS, 81.43% (11,860/14,564) WERE CLASSIFIED AS PROMOTIONAL AND 18.57% (2704/14,564) WERE CLASSIFIED AS LAYPEOPLE'S DISCUSSIONS. THE MOST DISCUSSED THEMES WERE TREATMENT (N=4080) AND GENETIC TESTING (N=3073). WE FOUND THAT THE TOPIC DISTRIBUTIONS IN LAYPEOPLE'S DISCUSSIONS WERE SIMILAR TO THE DISTRIBUTIONS IN PROMOTIONAL LYNCH SYNDROME-RELATED INFORMATION. FURTHERMORE, MOST PEOPLE HAD A POSITIVE ATTITUDE WHEN DISCUSSING LYNCH SYNDROME. THE PROPORTION OF NEGATIVE TWEETS WAS 3.51%. WITHIN EACH TOPIC, TREATMENT (16.67%) AND GENETIC TESTING (5.60%) HAD MORE NEGATIVE TWEETS COMPARED WITH OTHER TOPICS. WHEN COMPARING MONTHLY TRENDS, LAYPEOPLE'S DISCUSSIONS HAD A STRONG CORRELATION WITH PROMOTIONAL LYNCH SYNDROME-RELATED INFORMATION ON AWARENESS (R=.98, P<.001), WHILE THERE WERE MODERATE CORRELATIONS ON SCREENING (R=.602, P=.05), GENETIC TESTING (R=.624, P=.04), TREATMENT (R=.69, P=.02), AND RISK (R=.66, P=.03). WE ALSO DISCOVERED THAT THE COLON CANCER AWARENESS MONTH (MARCH 2017) AND THE LYNCH SYNDROME AWARENESS DAY (MARCH 22, 2017) HAD SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE IMPACTS ON LAYPEOPLE'S DISCUSSIONS AND THEIR ATTITUDES.

OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN REHOSPITALIZATION RATES AND ONLINE RATINGS OF SNFS; TO COMPARE THE ASSOCIATION OF REHOSPITALIZATION WITH RATINGS FROM A REVIEW WEBSITE VS MEDICARE NURSING HOME COMPARE (NHC) RATINGS; AND TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC TOPICS CONSISTENTLY REPORTED IN REVIEWS OF SNFS WITH THE HIGHEST VS LOWEST REHOSPITALIZATION RATES USING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A RETROSPECTIVE CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY OF 1536 SNFS WITH ONLINE REVIEWS ON YELP (A WEBSITE THAT ALLOWS CONSUMERS TO RATE AND REVIEW BUSINESSES AND SERVICES, SCORED ON A 1- TO 5-STAR RATING SCALE, WITH 1 STAR INDICATING THE LOWEST RATING AND 5 STARS INDICATING THE HIGHEST RATING) POSTED BETWEEN JANUARY 1, 2014, AND DECEMBER 31, 2018. THE COMBINED DATA SET INCLUDED 1536 SNFS WITH 8548 ONLINE REVIEWS, NHC RATINGS, AND READMISSION RATES. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A MEAN RATING FROM THE REVIEW WEBSITE WAS CALCULATED THROUGH THE END OF EACH YEAR. RISK-STANDARDIZED REHOSPITALIZATION RATES WERE OBTAINED FROM NHC. LINEAR REGRESSION WAS USED TO MEASURE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE REHOSPITALIZATION RATE OF A SNF AND THE ONLINE RATINGS. NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING WAS USED TO IDENTIFY TOPICS ASSOCIATED WITH REVIEWS OF SNFS IN THE TOP AND BOTTOM QUINTILES OF REHOSPITALIZATION RATES. RESULTS: THE 1536 SNFS IN THE SAMPLE HAD A MEDIAN OF 6 REVIEWS (INTERQUARTILE RANGE, 3-13 REVIEWS), WITH A MEAN (SD) REVIEW WEBSITE RATING OF 2.7 (1.1). THE SNFS WITH THE HIGHEST RATING ON BOTH THE REVIEW WEBSITE AND NHC HAD 2.0% LOWER REHOSPITALIZATION RATES COMPARED WITH THE SNFS WITH THE LOWEST RATING ON BOTH WEBSITES (21.3%; 95% CI, 20.7%-21.8%; VS 23.3%; 95% CI, 22.7%-24.0%; P = .04).

THE CLASSIC ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED ISSUES WHICH DIFFERENTIATED THE PROFESSIONS. MORE DOCTORS COMMENTED ON LACK OF FEEDBACK FOLLOWING INCIDENTS AND EVALUATED THE SYSTEM NEGATIVELY. MORE ALLIED HEALTH STAFF FOUND THAT THE SYSTEM LACKED FIELDS NECESSARY TO REPORT INCIDENTS. MORE NURSES COMPLAINED INCIDENT REPORTING WAS TIME CONSUMING. THE LEXIMANCER ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT WHILE THE PROFESSIONS ALL USED THE MORE FREQUENTLY EMPLOYED CONCEPTS (WHICH DESCRIBED BASIC COMPONENTS OF THE REPORTING SYSTEM), NURSES AND ALLIED HEALTH SHARED MANY ADDITIONAL CONCEPTS CONCERNED WITH ACTUAL REPORTING.

BACKGROUND: DEPRESSION IS A COMMON AND OFTEN UNDIAGNOSED CONDITION FOR PATIENTS WITH DIABETES. IT IS ALSO A CONDITION THAT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTS HEALTHCARE OUTCOMES, USE, AND COST AS WELL AS ELEVATING SUICIDE RISK. THEREFORE, A MODEL TO PREDICT DEPRESSION AMONG DIABETES PATIENTS IS A PROMISING AND VALUABLE TOOL FOR PROVIDERS TO PROACTIVELY ASSESS DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND IDENTIFY THOSE WITH DEPRESSION. OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY SEEKS TO DEVELOP A GENERALIZED MULTILEVEL REGRESSION MODEL, USING A LONGITUDINAL DATA SET FROM A RECENT LARGE-SCALE CLINICAL TRIAL, TO PREDICT DEPRESSION SEVERITY AND PRESENCE OF MAJOR DEPRESSION AMONG PATIENTS WITH DIABETES. METHODS: SEVERITY OF DEPRESSION WAS MEASURED BY THE PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE PHQ-9 SCORE. PREDICTORS WERE SELECTED FROM 29 CANDIDATE FACTORS TO DEVELOP A 2-LEVEL POISSON REGRESSION MODEL THAT CAN MAKE POPULATION-AVERAGE PREDICTIONS FOR ALL PATIENTS AND SUBJECT-SPECIFIC PREDICTIONS FOR INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS WITH HISTORICAL RECORDS. NEWLY OBTAINED PATIENT RECORDS CAN BE INCORPORATED WITH HISTORICAL RECORDS TO UPDATE THE PREDICTION MODEL. ROOT-MEAN-SQUARE ERRORS (RMSE) WERE USED TO EVALUATE PREDICTIVE ACCURACY OF PHQ-9 SCORES. THE STUDY ALSO EVALUATED THE CLASSIFICATION ABILITY OF USING THE PREDICTED PHQ-9 SCORES TO CLASSIFY PATIENTS AS HAVING MAJOR DEPRESSION. RESULTS: TWO TIME-INVARIANT AND 10 TIME-VARYING PREDICTORS WERE SELECTED FOR THE MODEL. INCORPORATING HISTORICAL RECORDS AND USING THEM TO UPDATE THE MODEL MAY IMPROVE BOTH PREDICTIVE ACCURACY OF PHQ-9 SCORES AND CLASSIFICATION ABILITY OF THE PREDICTED SCORES. SUBJECT-SPECIFIC PREDICTIONS (FOR INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS WITH HISTORICAL RECORDS) ACHIEVED RMSE ABOUT 4 AND AREAS UNDER THE RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC (ROC) CURVE ABOUT 0.9 AND ARE BETTER THAN POPULATION-AVERAGE PREDICTIONS.

A TOTAL OF 89,951 COMMENTS ON 650 ONLINE NEWS ARTICLES, REPORTED BETWEEN JANUARY 1, 2013 AND JULY 31, 2018, WERE COLLECTED VIA WEB CRAWLING. THE COLLECTED UNSTRUCTURED TEXT DATA WERE PREPROCESSED AND KEYWORD ANALYSIS AND TOPIC MODELING WERE PERFORMED USING R PROGRAMMING. RESULTS: THE 10 MOST IMPORTANT KEYWORDS WERE ""WORK"" (37121.7), ""HOSPITAL"" (25286.0), ""PATIENTS"" (24600.8), ""WOMAN"" (24015.6), ""PHYSICIAN"" (20840.6), ""TROUBLE"" (18539.4), ""TIME"" (17896.3), ""MONEY"" (16379.9), ""NEW NURSES"" (14056.8), AND ""SALARY"" (13084.1). THE 22,572 PREPROCESSED KEY WORDS WERE CATEGORIZED INTO FOUR TOPICS: ""POOR WORKING ENVIRONMENT"", ""CULTURE AMONG WOMEN"", ""UNFAIR OPPRESSION"", AND ""SOCIETY-LEVEL SOLUTIONS"". CONCLUSION: PUBLIC INTEREST IN WORKPLACE BULLYING AMONG NURSES HAS CONTINUED TO INCREASE. THE PUBLIC AGREED THAT NEGATIVE WORK ENVIRONMENT AND NURSING SHORTAGE COULD CAUSE WORKPLACE BULLYING. THEY ALSO CONSIDERED NURSE BULLYING AS A PROBLEM THAT SHOULD BE RESOLVED AT A SOCIETAL LEVEL. IT IS NECESSARY TO CONDUCT FURTHER RESEARCH THROUGH GENDER DISCRIMINATION PERSPECTIVES ON NURSE WORKPLACE BULLYING AND THE SOCIAL VALUE OF NURSING WORK.",0,1,0

ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES HAVE BEEN HEAVILY MARKETED ACROSS TWITTER FEEDS, OFFERING DISCOUNTS, ""KID-FRIENDLY"" FLAVORS, ALGORITHMICALLY GENERATED FALSE TESTIMONIALS, AND FREE SAMPLES. METHODS: ALL ELECTRONIC CIGARETTE KEYWORD RELATED TWEETS FROM A 10% SAMPLE OF TWITTER SPANNING JANUARY 2012 THROUGH DECEMBER 2014 (APPROXIMATELY 850,000 TOTAL TWEETS) WERE IDENTIFIED AND CATEGORIZED AS AUTOMATED OR ORGANIC BY COMBINING A KEYWORD CLASSIFICATION AND A MACHINE TRAINED HUMAN DETECTION ALGORITHM. A SENTIMENT ANALYSIS USING HEDONOMETRICS WAS PERFORMED ON ORGANIC TWEETS TO QUANTIFY THE CHANGE IN CONSUMER SENTIMENTS OVER TIME. COMMERCIALIZED TWEETS WERE TOPICALLY CATEGORIZED WITH KEY PHRASAL PATTERN MATCHING. RESULTS: THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY (80%) OF TWEETS WERE CLASSIFIED AS AUTOMATED OR PROMOTIONAL IN NATURE. THE MAJORITY OF THESE TWEETS WERE CODED AS COMMERCIALIZED (83.65% IN 2013), UP TO 33% OF WHICH OFFERED DISCOUNTS OR FREE SAMPLES AND APPEARED ON OVER A BILLION TWITTER FEEDS AS IMPRESSIONS. THE POSITIVITY OF ORGANIC (HUMAN) CLASSIFIED TWEETS HAS DECREASED OVER TIME (5.84 IN 2013 TO 5.77 IN 2014) DUE TO A RELATIVE INCREASE IN THE NEGATIVE WORDS 'BAN', 'TOBACCO', 'DOESN'T', 'DRUG', 'AGAINST', 'POISON', 'TAX' AND A RELATIVE DECREASE IN THE POSITIVE WORDS LIKE 'HAHA', 'GOOD', 'COOL'. AUTOMATED TWEETS ARE MORE POSITIVE THAN ORGANIC (6.17 VERSUS 5.84) DUE TO A RELATIVE INCREASE IN THE MARKETING WORDS LIKE 'BEST', 'WIN', 'BUY', 'SALE', 'HEALTH', 'DISCOUNT' AND A RELATIVE DECREASE IN NEGATIVE WORDS LIKE 'BAD', 'HATE', 'STUPID', 'DON'T'.

"788","H H, 2017, ","BACKGROUND: WORLDWIDE, PATIENTS HAVE POSTED MILLIONS OF ONLINE REVIEWS FOR THEIR DOCTORS. THE RICH TEXTUAL INFORMATION IN THE ONLINE REVIEWS HOLDS THE POTENTIAL TO GENERATE INSIGHTS INTO HOW PATIENTS' EXPERIENCE WITH THEIR DOCTORS DIFFER ACROSS NATIONS AND HOW SHOULD WE USE THEM TO IMPROVE OUR HEALTH SERVICE. OBJECTIVE: WE APPLY CUSTOMIZED TEXT MINING TECHNIQUES TO COMPARE ONLINE DOCTOR REVIEWS FROM CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES, IN ORDER TO MEASURE THE SYSTEMATIC DIFFERENCES IN PATIENT REVIEWS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES, AND ASSESS THE POTENTIAL INSIGHTS THAT CAN BE DERIVED FROM THIS LARGE VOLUME OF ONLINE TEXT DATA. METHODS: WE COMPARE THE TEXTUAL REVIEWS OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY (OBGYN) DOCTORS FROM THE TWO MOST POPULAR ONLINE DOCTOR RATING WEBSITES IN THE U.S. AND CHINA, RESPECTIVELY: RATEMDS.COM AND HAODF.COM. WE APPLY A CUSTOMIZED TEXT MINING TECHNIQUE, LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION (LDA) TOPIC MODELING TO IDENTIFY THE MAJOR TOPICS IN POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE REVIEWS OF THOSE TWO COUNTRIES. WE THEN COMPARE THEIR SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES. RESULTS: AMONG THE POSITIVE REVIEWS, BOTH CHINESE AND AMERICAN PATIENTS TALKED ABOUT MEDICAL TREATMENT, BEDSIDE MANNER, AND APPRECIATION/RECOMMENDATION, BUT CHINESE PATIENTS COMMENTED MORE ABOUT MEDICAL TREATMENT WHILE AMERICAN PATIENTS FOCUSED MORE ON RECOMMENDATION. ALSO, REVIEWS ABOUT BEDSIDE MANNER FROM CHINESE PATIENTS WERE MORE RELATED TO DOCTORS WHILE ON THE AMERICAN SIDE, THEY WERE MORE ABOUT STAFF. THIS REFLECTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES' HEALTH SYSTEMS. FURTHER, AMONG THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS, BOTH COUNTRIES' PATIENTS TALKED ABOUT MEDICAL TREATMENT, BEDSIDE MANNER, AND LOGISTICS. HOWEVER, CHINESE PATIENTS FOCUS MORE ON THE REGISTRATION PROCESS, WHILE AMERICAN PATIENTS ARE MORE RELATED TO THE STAFF, WAIT TIME, AND INSURANCE, WHICH FURTHER SHOWS THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO NATIONS' HEALTH SYSTEMS. CONCLUSIONS: ONLINE DOCTOR REVIEWS CONTAIN VALUABLE INFORMATION THAT CAN GENERATE INSIGHTS ON THE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES OF PATIENT EXPERIENCE ACROSS NATIONS. THEY ARE USEFUL ASSETS TO ASSIST HEALTHCARE CONSUMERS, PROVIDERS, AND ADMINISTRATORS IN MOVING TOWARD A PATIENT-CENTERED CARE.

RELAXATION IS OFTEN RECOMMENDED IN MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT AS A FRONTLINE STRATEGY TO REDUCE STRESS, THEREBY IMPROVING HEALTH CONDITIONS. TWITTER IS A MICROBLOG PLATFORM THAT ALLOWS USERS TO POST THEIR OWN PERSONAL MESSAGES (TWEETS), INCLUDING THEIR EXPRESSIONS ABOUT FEELINGS AND ACTIONS RELATED TO STRESS AND STRESS MANAGEMENT (EG, RELAXING). WHILE TWITTER IS INCREASINGLY USED AS A SOURCE OF DATA FOR UNDERSTANDING MENTAL HEALTH FROM A POPULATION PERSPECTIVE, THE SPECIFIC ISSUE OF STRESS-AS MANIFESTED ON TWITTER-HAS NOT YET BEEN THE FOCUS OF ANY SYSTEMATIC STUDY. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF OUR STUDY WAS TO UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE EXPRESS THEIR FEELINGS OF STRESS AND RELAXATION THROUGH TWITTER MESSAGES. IN ADDITION, WE AIMED AT INVESTIGATING AUTOMATED NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING METHODS TO (1) CLASSIFY STRESS VERSUS NONSTRESS AND RELAXATION VERSUS NONRELAXATION TWEETS, AND (2) IDENTIFY FIRST-HAND EXPERIENCE-THAT IS, WHO IS THE EXPERIENCER-IN STRESS AND RELAXATION TWEETS. METHODS: WE FIRST PERFORMED A QUALITATIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS OF 1326 AND 781 TWEETS CONTAINING THE KEYWORDS ""STRESS"" AND ""RELAX,"" RESPECTIVELY. WE THEN INVESTIGATED THE USE OF MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS-IN PARTICULAR NAIVE BAYES AND SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES-TO AUTOMATICALLY CLASSIFY TWEETS AS STRESS VERSUS NONSTRESS AND RELAXATION VERSUS NONRELAXATION. FINALLY, WE APPLIED THESE CLASSIFIERS TO SAMPLE DATASETS DRAWN FROM 4 CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES (LOS ANGELES, NEW YORK, SAN DIEGO, AND SAN FRANCISCO) OBTAINED FROM TWITTER'S STREAMING APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE, WITH THE GOAL OF EVALUATING THE EXTENT OF ANY CORRELATION BETWEEN OUR AUTOMATIC CLASSIFICATION OF TWEETS AND RESULTS FROM PUBLIC STRESS SURVEYS. RESULTS: CONTENT ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE MOST FREQUENT TOPIC OF STRESS TWEETS WAS EDUCATION, FOLLOWED BY WORK AND SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS. THE MOST FREQUENT TOPIC OF RELAXATION TWEETS WAS REST & VACATION, FOLLOWED BY NATURE AND WATER. WHEN WE APPLIED THE CLASSIFIERS TO THE CITIES DATASET, THE PROPORTION OF STRESS TWEETS IN NEW YORK AND SAN DIEGO WAS SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER THAN THAT IN LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO. IN ADDITION, WE FOUND THAT CHARACTERISTIC EXPRESSIONS OF STRESS AND RELAXATION VARIED FOR EACH CITY BASED ON ITS GEOLOCATION.

METHODS: ADVANCED MACHINE-LEARNING EMPOWERED METHODOLOGY WAS USED TO MINE AND STRUCTURE OPEN-SOURCE DIGITAL CONVERSATIONS OF SELF-IDENTIFYING TEENAGERS AND ADULTS WHO ENDORSED SUFFERING FROM EPILEPSY AND ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION ABOUT SUICIDE. THE SEARCH WAS LIMITED TO 12 MONTHS AND INCLUDED ONLY CONVERSATIONS ORIGINATING FROM US INTERNET PROTOCOL (IP) ADDRESSES. NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING AND TEXT ANALYTICS WERE EMPLOYED TO DEVELOP A THEMATIC ANALYSIS.

THE SUICIDE-RELATED CONVERSATIONS WERE POSTED BY 7.8% OF TEENAGERS AND 3.2% OF ADULTS IN THE STUDY. SEVERAL CRITICAL DIFFERENCES WERE NOTED BETWEEN TEENAGERS AND ADULTS. A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF TEENAGERS ARE: FEARFUL OF ""THE UNKNOWN"" DUE TO SEIZURES (63% VS 12% ADULTS), CONCERNED ABOUT SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES OF SEIZURES (30% VS 21%), AND SEEK EMOTIONAL SUPPORT (29% VS 19%). IN CONTRAST, A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF ADULTS SHOW A DEFEATIST (""GIVEN UP"") ATTITUDE COMPARED TO TEENAGERS (42% VS 4%). THERE WERE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES IN THE AUTHOR'S DETERMINED SENTIMENTS BEHIND THE CONVERSATIONS AMONG TEENAGERS AND ADULTS. SIGNIFICANCE: IN THIS FIRST OF ITS KIND BIG DATA ANALYSIS OF NEARLY A QUARTER-MILLION DIGITAL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT EPILEPSY USING MACHINE LEARNING, WE FOUND THAT TEENAGERS ENGAGE IN AN ONLINE CONVERSATION ABOUT SUICIDE MORE OFTEN THAN ADULTS.

"794","JW H, 2018, ","BACKGROUND: SOCIAL MEDIA IS AN IMPORTANT COMMUNICATION CHANNEL THAT CAN HELP HOSPITALS AND CONSUMERS OBTAIN FEEDBACK ABOUT QUALITY OF CARE. HOWEVER, DESPITE THE POTENTIAL VALUE OF INSIGHT FROM CONSUMERS WHO POST COMMENTS ABOUT HOSPITAL CARE ON SOCIAL MEDIA, THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE EMPIRICAL RESEARCH ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PATIENTS' ANECDOTAL FEEDBACK AND FORMAL MEASURES OF PATIENT EXPERIENCE. PURPOSE: THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO TEST THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN INFORMAL FEEDBACK POSTED IN THE REVIEWS SECTION OF HOSPITALS' FACEBOOK PAGES AND SCORES ON TWO GLOBAL ITEMS FROM THE HOSPITAL CONSUMER ASSESSMENT OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND SYSTEMS (HCAHPS) SURVEY, OVERALL HOSPITAL RATING AND WILLINGNESS TO RECOMMEND THE HOSPITAL. METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: WE RETRIEVED STAR RATINGS AND ANECDOTAL COMMENTS POSTED IN REVIEWS SECTIONS OF 131 HOSPITALS' FACEBOOK PAGES. USING A MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM, WE ANALYZED 57,985 COMMENTS TO MEASURE CONSUMERS' SENTIMENT ABOUT THE HOSPITALS. WE USED REGRESSION ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE WHETHER CONSUMERS' QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE POSTINGS WOULD PREDICT GLOBAL MEASURES FROM THE HCAHPS SURVEY. RESULTS: BOTH NUMBER OF STARS AND THE NUMBER OF POSITIVE COMMENTS POSTED ON HOSPITALS' FACEBOOK REVIEWS SECTIONS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER OVERALL RATINGS AND WILLINGNESS TO RECOMMEND THE HOSPITAL. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT PATIENTS' INFORMAL COMMENTS HELP PREDICT A HOSPITAL'S FORMAL MEASURES OF PATIENT EXPERIENCE. CONCLUSION: CONSISTENT WITH CROWD WISDOM, ORDINARY CONSUMERS MAY HAVE VALID INSIGHTS THAT CAN HELP OTHERS TO ASSESS PATIENT EXPERIENCE AT A HOSPITAL. GIVEN THAT SOME PEOPLE WILL JUDGE HOSPITAL QUALITY BASED ON OPINIONS VOICED IN SOCIAL MEDIA, FURTHER RESEARCH SHOULD CONTINUE TO EXPLORE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN ANECDOTAL COMMENTARY AND A VARIETY OF QUALITY INDICATORS. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: ADMINISTRATORS CAN TAP INTO THE WEALTH OF COMMENTARY ON SOCIAL MEDIA AS THE FORUM CONTINUES TO EXPAND ITS INFLUENCE IN HEALTH CARE.

BY TREATING NEWS REPORTERS AS DATA COLLECTORS AND THEIR REPORTS AS QUALITATIVE ACCOUNTS OF A FAST CHANGING PUBLIC HEALTH LANDSCAPE, RESEARCHERS CAN GLEAN MANY VALUABLE INSIGHTS. YET, THERE HAVE BEEN SURPRISINGLY FEW INNOVATIONS IN PUBLIC HEALTH MEDIA MONITORING, WITH NEARLY ALL STUDIES RELYING ON LABOR-INTENSIVE CONTENT ANALYSES LIMITED TO A SMALL NUMBER OF MEDIA REPORTS. WE PROPOSE TO ADVANCE THIS SUBFIELD BY USING SCALABLE MACHINE LEARNING. IN POTENTIALLY THE LARGEST CONTEMPORARY PUBLIC HEALTH MEDIA MONITORING STUDY TO DATE, WE SYSTEMATICALLY CHARACTERIZE GLOBAL NEWS REPORTS SURROUNDING ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES OR ELECTRONIC NICOTINE DELIVERY SYSTEMS (ENDS) USING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES. NEWS REPORTS INCLUDING ENDS TERMS (E.G., ""ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES"") FROM OVER 100,000 SOURCES (ALL SOURCES ARCHIVED ON GOOGLE NEWS OR BING NEWS, AS WELL AS ALL NEWS ARTICLES SHARED ON TWITTER) WERE MONITORED FOR 1 JANUARY 2013 THROUGH 31 JULY 2018. THE GEOGRAPHIC AND SUBJECT (E.G., PREVALENCE, BANS, QUITTING, WARNINGS, MARKETING, PRICES, AGE, FLAVOR AND INDUSTRY) FOCI OF NEWS ARTICLES, THEIR POPULARITY AMONG READERS WHO SHARE NEWS ON SOCIAL MEDIA, AND THE SENTIMENT BEHIND NEWS ARTICLES WERE ASSESSED ALGORITHMICALLY. GLOBALLY THERE WERE 86,872 ENDS NEWS REPORTS WITH COVERAGE INCREASING FROM 8 (STANDARD DEVIATION [SD] = 8) STORIES PER DAY IN 2013 TO 75 (SD = 56) STORIES PER DAY DURING 2018. THE FOCUS OF ENDS NEWS SPANNED 148 NATIONS, WITH THE PLURALITY FOCUSING ON THE UNITED STATES (34% OF ALL NEWS). POTENTIALLY OVERLOOKED HOTSPOTS OF ENDS MEDIA ACTIVITY INCLUDED CHINA, EGYPT, RUSSIA, UKRAINE, AND PARAGUAY. THE MOST COMMON SUBJECT WAS WARNINGS ABOUT ENDS (18%), FOLLOWED BY BANS ON USING ENDS (13%) AND ENDS PRICES (9%). FLAVOR AND AGE RESTRICTIONS WERE THE LEAST COVERED NEWS SUBJECTS ( 1% EACH). AMONG DIFFERENT SUBJECT FOCI, REPORTS ON QUITTING CIGARETTES USING ENDS HAD THE HIGHEST PROBABILITY OF SCORING IN THE TOP THREE DECILES OF POPULARITY RANKINGS. MOREOVER, ENDS NEWS ON QUITTING AND PRICES HAD A MORE POSITIVE SENTIMENT ON AVERAGE THAN NEWS WITH OTHER SUBJECT FOCI. PUBLIC HEALTH LEADERS CAN USE THESE TRENDS TO STAY ABREAST OF HOW ENDS ARE PORTRAYED IN THE MEDIA, AND POTENTIALLY HOW THE PUBLIC PERCEIVES ENDS.

"805","A P, 2019, ","WIDELY-PRESCRIBED PRODRUG OPIOIDS (E.G., HYDROCODONE) REQUIRE CONVERSION BY LIVER ENZYME CYP-2D6 TO EXERT THEIR ANALGESIC EFFECTS. THE MOST COMMONLY PRESCRIBED ANTIDEPRESSANT, SELECTIVE SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INHIBITORS (SSRIS), INHIBITS CYP-2D6 ACTIVITY AND THEREFORE MAY REDUCE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PRODRUG OPIOIDS. WE USED A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH TO IDENTIFY PATIENTS PRESCRIBED A COMBINATION OF SSRIS AND PRODRUG OPIOIDS POSTOPERATIVELY AND TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF THIS COMBINATION ON POSTOPERATIVE PAIN CONTROL. USING EHR DATA FROM AN ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER, WE IDENTIFIED PATIENTS RECEIVING SURGERY OVER A 9-YEAR PERIOD. WE DEVELOPED AND VALIDATED NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) ALGORITHMS TO EXTRACT DEPRESSION-RELATED INFORMATION (DIAGNOSIS, SSRI USE, SYMPTOMS) FROM STRUCTURED AND UNSTRUCTURED DATA ELEMENTS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PREOPERATIVE PAIN SCORE AND POSTOPERATIVE PAIN AT DISCHARGE, 3-WEEK AND 8-WEEK TIME POINTS. WE DEVELOPED COMPUTATIONAL MODELS TO PREDICT THE INCREASE OR DECREASE IN THE POSTOPERATIVE PAIN ACROSS THE 3 TIME POINTS BY USING THE PATIENT'S EHR DATA (E.G. MEDICATIONS, VITALS, DEMOGRAPHICS) CAPTURED BEFORE SURGERY. WE EVALUATE THE GENERALIZABILITY OF THE MODEL USING 10-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION METHOD WHERE THE HOLDOUT TEST METHOD IS REPEATED 10 TIMES AND MEAN AREA-UNDER-THE-CURVE (AUC) IS CONSIDERED AS EVALUATION METRICS FOR THE PREDICTION PERFORMANCE. WE IDENTIFIED 4,306 SURGICAL PATIENTS WITH SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION. A TOTAL OF 14.1% WERE PRESCRIBED BOTH AN SSRI AND A PRODRUG OPIOID, 29.4% WERE PRESCRIBED AN SSRI AND A NON-PRODRUG OPIOID, 18.6% WERE PRESCRIBED A PRODRUG OPIOID BUT WERE NOT ON SSRIS, AND 37.5% WERE PRESCRIBED A NON-PRODRUG OPIOID BUT WERE NOT ON SSRIS. OUR NLP ALGORITHM IDENTIFIED DEPRESSION WITH A F1 SCORE OF 0.95 AGAINST MANUAL ANNOTATION OF 300 RANDOMLY SAMPLED CLINICAL NOTES. ON AVERAGE, PATIENTS RECEIVING PRODRUG OPIOIDS HAD LOWER AVERAGE PAIN SCORES (P<0.05), WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE SSRI+ GROUP AT 3-WEEKS POSTOPERATIVE FOLLOW-UP. HOWEVER, SSRI+/PRODRUG+ HAD SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE PAIN CONTROL AT DISCHARGE, 3 AND 8-WEEK FOLLOW-UP (P < .01) COMPARED TO SSRI+/PRODRUG- PATIENTS, WHEREAS THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN PAIN CONTROL AMONG THE SSRI- PATIENTS BY PRODRUG OPIOID (P>0.05). THE MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM ACCURATELY PREDICTED THE INCREASE OR DECREASE OF THE DISCHARGE, 3-WEEK AND 8-WEEK FOLLOW-UP PAIN SCORES WHEN COMPARED TO THE PRE-OPERATIVE PAIN SCORE USING 10-FOLD CROSS VALIDATION (MEAN AREA UNDER THE RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC CURVE 0.87, 0.81, AND 0.69, RESPECTIVELY). PREOPERATIVE PAIN, SURGERY TYPE, AND OPIOID TOLERANCE WERE THE STRONGEST PREDICTORS OF POSTOPERATIVE PAIN CONTROL. WE PROVIDE THE FIRST DIRECT CLINICAL EVIDENCE THAT THE KNOWN ABILITY OF SSRIS TO INHIBIT PRODRUG OPIOID EFFECTIVENESS IS ASSOCIATED WITH WORSE PAIN CONTROL AMONG DEPRESSED PATIENTS. CURRENT PRESCRIBING PATTERNS INDICATE THAT PRESCRIBERS MAY NOT ACCOUNT FOR THIS INTERACTION WHEN CHOOSING AN OPIOID. THE STUDY RESULTS IMPLY THAT PRESCRIBERS MIGHT INSTEAD CHOOSE DIRECT ACTING OPIOIDS (E.G. OXYCODONE OR MORPHINE) IN DEPRESSED PATIENTS ON SSRIS.",0,1,0

IN THE PRESENT STUDY, WE EXAMINED ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN LANGUAGE USE ON FACEBOOK AND PROBLEMATIC ALCOHOL USE. WE COLLECTED TEXTS SHARED ON FACEBOOK BY A SAMPLE OF 296 ADULT SOCIAL MEDIA USERS (66.9% FEMALES; MEAN AGE = 28.44 YEARS (SD = 7.38)). TEXTS WERE MINED USING THE CLOSED-VOCABULARY APPROACH BASED ON THE LINGUISTIC INQUIRY WORD COUNT (LIWC) SEMANTIC DICTIONARY, AND AN OPEN-VOCABULARY APPROACH PERFORMED VIA LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION (LDA). THEN, WE EXAMINED ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN EMERGING TEXTUAL FEATURES AND ALCOHOL-DRINKING SCORES AS ASSESSED USING THE AUDIT-C QUESTIONNAIRE. AS A FINAL AIM, WE EMPLOYED THE RANDOM FOREST MACHINE-LEARNING ALGORITHM TO DETERMINE AND COMPARE THE PREDICTIVE ACCURACY OF CLOSED- AND OPEN-VOCABULARY FEATURES OVER USERS' AUDIT-C SCORES. WE FOUND USE OF WORDS ABOUT FAMILY, SCHOOL, AND POSITIVE FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS TO BE NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH ALCOHOL USE AND PROBLEMATIC DRINKING, WHILE WORDS SUGGESTING INTEREST IN SPORT EVENTS, POLITICS AND ECONOMICS, NIGHTLIFE, AND USE OF COARSE LANGUAGE WERE MORE FREQUENT AMONG PROBLEMATIC DRINKERS. RESULTS COMING FROM LIWC AND LDA ANALYSES WERE QUITE SIMILAR, BUT LDA ADDED INFORMATION THAT COULD NOT BE RETRIEVED ONLY WITH LIWC ANALYSIS. FURTHERMORE, OPEN-VOCABULARY FEATURES OUTPERFORMED CLOSED-VOCABULARY FEATURES IN TERMS OF PREDICTIVE POWER OVER PARTICIPANTS' AUDIT-C SCORES (R = .46 VS. R = .28, RESPECTIVELY).

OBJECTIVE: THE AIM WAS TO STUDY EMOTIONAL REACTIONS TO PRO-ANOREXIA AND ANTI-PRO-ANOREXIA ONLINE CONTENT ON YOUTUBE USING SENTIMENT ANALYSIS. METHODS: USING THE 50 MOST POPULAR YOUTUBE PRO-ANOREXIA AND ANTI-PRO-ANOREXIA USER CHANNELS AS A STARTING POINT, WE GATHERED DATA ON USERS, THEIR VIDEOS, AND THEIR COMMENTATORS. A TOTAL OF 395 ANOREXIA VIDEOS AND 12,161 COMMENTS WERE ANALYZED USING POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SENTIMENTS AND RATINGS SUBMITTED BY THE VIEWERS OF THE VIDEOS. THE EMOTIONAL INFORMATION WAS AUTOMATICALLY EXTRACTED WITH AN AUTOMATIC SENTIMENT DETECTION TOOL WHOSE RELIABILITY WAS TESTED WITH HUMAN CODERS. ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES REGRESSION MODELS WERE USED TO ESTIMATE THE STRENGTH OF SENTIMENTS. THE MODELS CONTROLLED FOR THE NUMBER OF VIDEO VIEWS AND COMMENTS, NUMBER OF MONTHS THE VIDEO HAD BEEN ON YOUTUBE, DURATION OF THE VIDEO, UPLOADER'S ACTIVITY AS A VIDEO COMMENTATOR, AND UPLOADER'S PHYSICAL LOCATION BY COUNTRY. RESULTS: THE 395 VIDEOS HAD MORE THAN 6 MILLION VIEWS AND COMMENTS BY ALMOST 8000 USERS. ANTI-PRO-ANOREXIA VIDEO COMMENTS EXPRESSED MORE POSITIVE SENTIMENTS ON A SCALE OF 1 TO 5 (ADJUSTED PREDICTION [AP] 2.15, 95% CI 2.11-2.19) THAN DID THOSE OF PRO-ANOREXIA VIDEOS (AP 2.02, 95% CI 1.98-2.06). ANTI-PRO-ANOREXIA VIDEOS ALSO RECEIVED MORE LIKES (AP 181.02, 95% CI 155.19-206.85) THAN PRO-ANOREXIA VIDEOS (AP 31.22, 95% CI 31.22-37.81). NEGATIVE SENTIMENTS AND VIDEO DISLIKES WERE EQUALLY DISTRIBUTED IN RESPONSES TO BOTH PRO-ANOREXIA AND ANTI-PRO-ANOREXIA VIDEOS. CONCLUSIONS: DESPITE PRO-ANOREXIA CONTENT BEING WIDESPREAD ON YOUTUBE, VIDEOS PROMOTING HELP FOR ANOREXIA AND OPPOSING THE PRO-ANOREXIA COMMUNITY WERE MORE POPULAR, GAINING MORE POSITIVE FEEDBACK AND COMMENTS THAN PRO-ANOREXIA VIDEOS.

OXMIS REQUIRES FURTHER EXTERNAL VALIDATION, BUT A LACK OF LARGE-SCALE COHORTS WITH RELEVANT VARIABLES MAKES THIS CHALLENGING. ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS PROVIDE POSSIBLE DATA SOURCES FOR EXTERNAL VALIDATION OF RISK PREDICTION TOOLS. HOWEVER, THEY CONTAIN LARGE AMOUNTS OF INFORMATION WITHIN FREE-TEXT THAT IS NOT READILY EXTRACTABLE. IN THIS STUDY, WE EXAMINED THE FEASIBILITY OF IDENTIFYING SUICIDE PREDICTORS NEEDED TO VALIDATE OXMIS IN ROUTINELY COLLECTED ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS. METHODS: IN STUDY 1, WE MANUALLY REVIEWED ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS OF 57 PATIENTS WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS TO CALCULATE OXMIS RISK SCORES. IN STUDY 2, WE EXAMINED THE FEASIBILITY OF USING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TO SCALE UP THIS PROCESS. WE USED ANONYMIZED FREE-TEXT DOCUMENTS FROM THE CLINICAL RECORD INTERACTIVE SEARCH DATABASE TO TRAIN A NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION MODEL, A MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUE WHICH RECOGNIZES CONCEPTS IN FREE-TEXT. THE MODEL IDENTIFIED EIGHT CONCEPTS RELEVANT FOR SUICIDE RISK ASSESSMENT: MEDICATION (ANTIDEPRESSANT/ANTIPSYCHOTIC TREATMENT), VIOLENCE, EDUCATION, SELF-HARM, BENEFITS RECEIPT, DRUG/ALCOHOL USE DISORDER, SUICIDE, AND PSYCHIATRIC ADMISSION. WE ASSESSED MODEL PERFORMANCE IN TERMS OF PRECISION (SIMILAR TO POSITIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE), RECALL (SIMILAR TO SENSITIVITY) AND F1 STATISTIC (AN OVERALL PERFORMANCE MEASURE). RESULTS: IN STUDY 1, WE ESTIMATED SUICIDE RISK FOR ALL PATIENTS USING THE OXMIS CALCULATOR, GIVING A RANGE OF 12 MONTH RISK ESTIMATES FROM 0.1-3.4%. FOR 13 OUT OF 17 PREDICTORS, THERE WAS NO MISSING INFORMATION IN ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS. FOR THE REMAINING 4 PREDICTORS MISSINGNESS RANGED FROM 7-26%; TO ACCOUNT FOR THESE MISSING VARIABLES, IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR OXMIS TO ESTIMATE SUICIDE RISK USING A RANGE OF SCORES. IN STUDY 2, THE NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION MODEL HAD AN OVERALL PRECISION OF 0.77, RECALL OF 0.90 AND F1 SCORE OF 0.83.

METHODS: AN INSTITUTIONAL REGISTRY WAS USED TO LINK THE RECORDS OF 186 PATIENTS WHO HAD UNDERGONE ELECTIVE PRIMARY TSA BETWEEN 2016 AND 2017 WITH VENDOR-SUPPLIED PATIENT SATISFACTION DATA, WHICH INCLUDED PATIENT COMMENTS AND THE HOSPITAL CONSUMER ASSESSMENT OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND SYSTEMS (HCAHPS) SURVEY. USING A MACHINE-LEARNING-BASED NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING APPROACH, ALL PATIENT COMMENTS WERE MINED FOR SENTIMENT AND CLASSIFIED AS POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, MIXED, OR NEUTRAL. NEGATIVE COMMENTS WERE FURTHER CLASSIFIED INTO THEMES. MULTIVARIABLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION WAS EMPLOYED TO DETERMINE CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING A NEGATIVE COMMENT. RESULTS: MOST PATIENTS (71%) PROVIDED AT LEAST 1 COMMENT; 32% OF THE COMMENTS WERE NEGATIVE, 62% WERE POSITIVE, 5% WERE MIXED, AND 1% WERE NEUTRAL. THE THEMES OF THE NEGATIVE COMMENTS WERE ROOM CONDITION (27%), TIME MANAGEMENT (17%), INEFFICIENT COMMUNICATION (13%), LACK OF COMPASSION (12%), DIFFICULT INTRAVENOUS (IV) INSERTION (10%), FOOD (10%), MEDICATION SIDE EFFECTS (6%), DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS (4%), AND PAIN MANAGEMENT (2%). WOMEN AND SICKER PATIENTS WERE MORE LIKELY TO PROVIDE NEGATIVE COMMENTS. PATIENTS WHO MADE NEGATIVE COMMENTS WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE DISSATISFIED WITH OVERALL HOSPITAL CARE AND WITH PAIN MANAGEMENT (2 HCAHPS CORE ITEMS), BUT THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES IN ANY OF THE STUDIED OUTCOMES (PEAK PAIN INTENSITY, OPIOID INTAKE, OPERATIVE TIME, HOSPITAL LENGTH OF STAY, DISCHARGE DISPOSITION, OR 1-YEAR AMERICAN SHOULDER AND ELBOW SURGEONS [ASES] SCORE) BETWEEN THOSE WHO PROVIDED NEGATIVE COMMENTS AND THOSE WHO DID NOT.

METHOD: IN STUDY 1, PARTICIPANTS (N (1) = 997) RESPONDED TO THE SHORT CHARACTER INVENTORY, WHICH MEASURES SELF-DIRECTEDNESS, COOPERATIVENESS, AND SELF-TRANSCENDENCE. IN STUDY 2, PARTICIPANTS (N (2) = 2373) RESPONDED TO SHORT DARK TRIAD, WHICH MEASURES MACHIAVELLIANISM, NARCISSISM, AND PSYCHOPATHY. IN BOTH STUDIES, RESPONDENTS WERE ASKED TO GENERATE 10 SELF-DESCRIPTIVE WORDS.

RESULTS: THE SEMANTIC REPRESENTATION OF EACH CHARACTER TRAIT WAS RELATED TO EACH CORRESPONDING SELF-REPORTED SCORE. HOWEVER, PARTICIPANTS' SELF-TRANSCENDENCE AND MACHIAVELLIANISM SCORES DEMONSTRATED SIMILAR RELATIONSHIPS TO ALL THREE SEMANTIC REPRESENTATIONS OF THE CHARACTER TRAITS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE PERSONALITY MODEL. THE ONE-DIMENSIONAL ANALYSES SHOWED THAT, FOR EXAMPLE, ""LOVING"" WAS INDICATIVE OF BOTH HIGH COOPERATIVENESS AND SELF-TRANSCENDENCE, WHILE ""COMPASSIONATE,"" ""KIND,"" AND ""CARING"" WAS UNIQUE FOR INDIVIDUALS HIGH IN COOPERATIVENESS. THE WORDS ""KIND"" AND ""CARING"" INDICATED LOW LEVELS OF MACHIAVELLIANISM AND PSYCHOPATHY, WHEREAS ""SHY"" OR ""INTROVERT"" INDICATED LOW NARCISSISM.

METHODS: OUR CASE STUDY IS THE ONGOING HORYZONS SITE (5-YEAR RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL FOR YOUTH RECOVERING FROM EARLY PSYCHOSIS), WHICH IS POWERED BY MOST. WE OUTLINE THE MOTIVATION UNDERLYING THE PROJECT AND THE WEB APPLICATION'S FOUNDATIONAL FEATURES AND INTERFACE. WE DISCUSS SYSTEM INNOVATIONS, INCLUDING THE INCORPORATION OF PERTINENT USAGE PATTERNS AS WELL AS IDENTIFYING CERTAIN LIMITATIONS OF THE SYSTEM. THIS LEADS TO OUR CURRENT MOTIVATIONS AND FOCUS ON USING COMPUTATIONAL AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE METHODS TO ENHANCE USER ENGAGEMENT, AND TO FURTHER IMPROVE THE SYSTEM WITH NOVEL MECHANISMS FOR THE DELIVERY OF THERAPY CONTENT TO USERS. IN PARTICULAR, WE COVER OUR USAGE OF NATURAL LANGUAGE ANALYSIS AND CHATBOT TECHNOLOGIES AS STRATEGIES TO TAILOR INTERVENTIONS AND SCALE UP THE SYSTEM. CONCLUSIONS: TO DATE, THE INNOVATIVE MOST SYSTEM HAS DEMONSTRATED VIABILITY IN A SERIES OF CLINICAL RESEARCH TRIALS. GIVEN THE DATA-DRIVEN OPPORTUNITIES AFFORDED BY THE SOFTWARE SYSTEM, OBSERVED USAGE PATTERNS, AND THE AIM TO DEPLOY IT ON A GREATER SCALE, AN IMPORTANT NEXT STEP IN ITS EVOLUTION IS THE INCORPORATION OF ADVANCED AND AUTOMATED CONTENT DELIVERY MECHANISMS.",1,1,1

"841","CY B, 2016, ","REAL-TIME MONITORING OF MAINSTREAM AND SOCIAL MEDIA CAN INFORM PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTITIONERS AND POLICY MAKERS ABOUT VACCINE SENTIMENT AND HESITANCY. WE DESCRIBE A PUBLICLY AVAILABLE PLATFORM FOR MONITORING VACCINATION-RELATED CONTENT, CALLED THE VACCINE SENTIMETER. WITH AUTOMATED DATA COLLECTION FROM 100,000 MAINSTREAM MEDIA SOURCES AND TWITTER, NATURAL-LANGUAGE PROCESSING FOR AUTOMATED FILTERING, AND MANUAL CURATION TO ENSURE ACCURACY, THE VACCINE SENTIMETER OFFERS A GLOBAL REAL-TIME VIEW OF VACCINATION CONVERSATIONS ONLINE. TO ASSESS THE SYSTEM'S UTILITY, WE FOLLOWED TWO EVENTS: POLIO VACCINATION IN PAKISTAN AFTER A NEWS STORY ABOUT A CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY VACCINATION RUSE AND SUBSEQUENT ATTACKS ON HEALTH CARE WORKERS, AND A CONTROVERSIAL EPISODE IN A TELEVISION PROGRAM ABOUT ADVERSE EVENTS FOLLOWING HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS VACCINATION. FOR BOTH EVENTS, INCREASED ONLINE ACTIVITY WAS DETECTED AND CHARACTERIZED. FOR THE FIRST EVENT, TWITTER RESPONSE TO THE ATTACKS ON HEALTH CARE WORKERS DECREASED DRASTICALLY AFTER THE FIRST ATTACK, IN CONTRAST TO MAINSTREAM MEDIA COVERAGE. FOR THE SECOND EVENT, THE MAINSTREAM AND SOCIAL MEDIA RESPONSE WAS LARGELY POSITIVE ABOUT THE HPV VACCINE, BUT ANTIVACCINE CONVERSATIONS PERSISTED LONGER THAN THE PROVACCINE REACTION. USING THE VACCINE SENTIMETER COULD ENABLE PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TO DETECT INCREASED ONLINE ACTIVITY OR SUDDEN SHIFTS IN SENTIMENT THAT COULD AFFECT VACCINATION UPTAKE.",1,1,0

IDENTIFYING AND ANALYSING THE CONTENT OF POSTS SENT TO HOSPITALS MAY PROVIDE A NOVEL REAL-TIME MEASURE OF QUALITY, SUPPLEMENTING TRADITIONAL, SURVEY-BASED APPROACHES. OBJECTIVE: TO ASSESS THE USE OF TWITTER AS A SUPPLEMENTAL DATA STREAM FOR MEASURING PATIENT-PERCEIVED QUALITY OF CARE IN US HOSPITALS AND COMPARE PATIENT SENTIMENTS ABOUT HOSPITALS WITH ESTABLISHED QUALITY MEASURES. DESIGN: 404 065 TWEETS DIRECTED TO 2349 US HOSPITALS OVER A 1-YEAR PERIOD WERE CLASSIFIED AS HAVING TO DO WITH PATIENT EXPERIENCE USING A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH. SENTIMENT WAS CALCULATED FOR THESE TWEETS USING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING. 11 602 TWEETS WERE MANUALLY CATEGORISED INTO PATIENT EXPERIENCE TOPICS. FINALLY, HOSPITALS WITH 50 PATIENT EXPERIENCE TWEETS WERE SURVEYED TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY USE TWITTER TO INTERACT WITH PATIENTS. KEY RESULTS: ROUGHLY HALF OF THE HOSPITALS IN THE US HAVE A PRESENCE ON TWITTER. OF THE TWEETS DIRECTED TOWARD THESE HOSPITALS, 34 725 (9.4%) WERE RELATED TO PATIENT EXPERIENCE AND COVERED DIVERSE TOPICS. ANALYSES LIMITED TO HOSPITALS WITH 50 PATIENT EXPERIENCE TWEETS REVEALED THAT THEY WERE MORE ACTIVE ON TWITTER, MORE LIKELY TO BE BELOW THE NATIONAL MEDIAN OF MEDICARE PATIENTS (P<0.001) AND ABOVE THE NATIONAL MEDIAN FOR NURSE/PATIENT RATIO (P=0.006), AND TO BE A NON-PROFIT HOSPITAL (P<0.001). AFTER ADJUSTING FOR HOSPITAL CHARACTERISTICS, WE FOUND THAT TWITTER SENTIMENT WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH HOSPITAL CONSUMER ASSESSMENT OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND SYSTEMS (HCAHPS) RATINGS (BUT HAVING A TWITTER ACCOUNT WAS), ALTHOUGH THERE WAS A WEAK ASSOCIATION WITH 30-DAY HOSPITAL READMISSION RATES (P=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: TWEETS DESCRIBING PATIENT EXPERIENCES IN HOSPITALS COVER A WIDE RANGE OF PATIENT CARE ASPECTS AND CAN BE IDENTIFIED USING AUTOMATED APPROACHES. THESE TWEETS REPRESENT A POTENTIALLY UNTAPPED INDICATOR OF QUALITY AND MAY BE VALUABLE TO PATIENTS, RESEARCHERS, POLICY MAKERS AND HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATORS.",1,1,0
"843","Q L, 2020, ","BACKGROUND: IN DECEMBER 2019, A FEW CORONAVIRUS DISEASE (COVID-19) CASES WERE FIRST REPORTED IN WUHAN, HUBEI, CHINA. SOON AFTER, INCREASING NUMBERS OF CASES WERE DETECTED IN OTHER PARTS OF CHINA, EVENTUALLY LEADING TO A DISEASE OUTBREAK IN CHINA. AS THIS DREADFUL DISEASE SPREADS RAPIDLY, THE MASS MEDIA HAS BEEN ACTIVE IN COMMUNITY EDUCATION ON COVID-19 BY DELIVERING HEALTH INFORMATION ABOUT THIS NOVEL CORONAVIRUS, SUCH AS ITS PATHOGENESIS, SPREAD, PREVENTION, AND CONTAINMENT. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COLLECT MEDIA REPORTS ON COVID-19 AND INVESTIGATE THE PATTERNS OF MEDIA-DIRECTED HEALTH COMMUNICATIONS AS WELL AS THE ROLE OF THE MEDIA IN THIS ONGOING COVID-19 CRISIS IN CHINA. METHODS: WE ADOPTED THE WISESEARCH DATABASE TO EXTRACT RELATED NEWS ARTICLES ABOUT THE CORONAVIRUS FROM MAJOR PRESS MEDIA BETWEEN JANUARY 1, 2020, AND FEBRUARY 20, 2020. WE THEN SORTED AND ANALYZED THE DATA USING PYTHON SOFTWARE AND PYTHON PACKAGE JIEBA. WE SOUGHT A SUITABLE TOPIC NUMBER WITH EVIDENCE OF THE COHERENCE NUMBER. WE OPERATED LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION TOPIC MODELING WITH A SUITABLE TOPIC NUMBER AND GENERATED CORRESPONDING KEYWORDS AND TOPIC NAMES. WE THEN DIVIDED THESE TOPICS INTO DIFFERENT THEMES BY PLOTTING THEM INTO A 2D PLANE VIA MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALING. RESULTS: AFTER REMOVING DUPLICATIONS AND IRRELEVANT REPORTS, OUR SEARCH IDENTIFIED 7791 RELEVANT NEWS REPORTS. WE LISTED THE NUMBER OF ARTICLES PUBLISHED PER DAY. ACCORDING TO THE COHERENCE VALUE, WE CHOSE 20 AS THE NUMBER OF TOPICS AND GENERATED THE TOPICS' THEMES AND KEYWORDS. THESE TOPICS WERE CATEGORIZED INTO NINE MAIN PRIMARY THEMES BASED ON THE TOPIC VISUALIZATION FIGURE. THE TOP THREE MOST POPULAR THEMES WERE PREVENTION AND CONTROL PROCEDURES, MEDICAL TREATMENT AND RESEARCH, AND GLOBAL OR LOCAL SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC INFLUENCES, ACCOUNTING FOR 32.57% (N=2538), 16.08% (N=1258), AND 11.79% (N=919) OF THE COLLECTED REPORTS, RESPECTIVELY. CONCLUSIONS: TOPIC MODELING OF NEWS ARTICLES CAN PRODUCE USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF MASS MEDIA FOR EARLY HEALTH COMMUNICATION. COMPARING THE NUMBER OF ARTICLES FOR EACH DAY AND THE OUTBREAK DEVELOPMENT, WE NOTED THAT MASS MEDIA NEWS REPORTS IN CHINA LAGGED BEHIND THE DEVELOPMENT OF COVID-19. THE MAJOR THEMES ACCOUNTED FOR AROUND HALF THE CONTENT AND TENDED TO FOCUS ON THE LARGER SOCIETY RATHER THAN ON INDIVIDUALS. THE COVID-19 CRISIS HAS BECOME A WORLDWIDE ISSUE, AND SOCIETY HAS BECOME CONCERNED ABOUT DONATIONS AND SUPPORT AS WELL AS MENTAL HEALTH AMONG OTHERS. WE RECOMMEND THAT FUTURE WORK ADDRESSES THE MASS MEDIA'S ACTUAL IMPACT ON READERS DURING THE COVID-19 CRISIS THROUGH SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF NEWS DATA.",1,1,0

A MISMATCH BETWEEN HOW PEOPLE THINK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AND WHAT MESSAGES ARE USED IN MENTAL HEALTH CAMPAIGNS MAY HINDER ATTEMPTS TO IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS AND REDUCE STIGMA. WE HAVE CONDUCTED FRAME ANALYSIS BY USING A COMBINATION OF TOPIC MODELING AND SENTIMENT ANALYSIS, EXAMINING 10 YEARS OF MENTAL HEALTH-RELATED TWEETS (N = 695,414). THE RESULTS REVEAL SEVEN DISTINCTIVE MENTAL HEALTH FRAMES: 'AWARENESS', 'FEELINGS AND PROBLEMATIZATION', 'CLASSIFICATION', 'ACCESSIBILITY AND FUNDING', 'STIGMA', 'SERVICE', AND 'YOUTH' (ARRANGED BY SALIENCE). IN ANALYZING THESE FRAMES, WE HAVE LEARNED THAT (1) THE GENERAL AWARENESS ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH RELATES TO MENTAL ILLNESS, WHILE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING FRAMING, ALTHOUGH PRESENT, IS PRONE TO LOW QUALITY OF INFORMATION, (2) MENTAL HEALTH DISCOURSE IS OFTEN USED TO PROBLEMATIZE SOCIAL ISSUES AND EXTERNALIZE PERSONAL ANXIETIES, WHICH TENDS TOWARD TRIVIALIZATION AND, POSSIBLY, TREATMENT DELAYS, (3) MENTAL HEALTH DISCOURSE OFTEN REVOLVES AROUND POPULARIZED MENTAL ILLNESS (E.G., DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, BUT NOT NEUROCOGNITIVE DISEASES), (4) THE MENTAL HEALTH 'STIGMA' FRAME IS NOT OVERLY PRONOUNCED; IT REVOLVES AROUND VIOLENCE, FEAR, AND MADNESS, (5) MENTAL HEALTH IS FREQUENTLY POLITICIZED, ESPECIALLY CONCERNING GUN LAWS IN THE US AND SERVICE ACCESSIBILITY AND FUNDING IN THE UK. ADDITIONALLY, SOME NARROWER FRAMES DISCOVERED MAY WARRANT FURTHER EXAMINATION. FOR INSTANCE, PTSD IS MOSTLY FRAMED AROUND VETERANS AND SUICIDE, ADHD AROUND YOUTH, AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE IN RELATION TO WOMEN, TEENS, AND IMPOVERISHED.",0,1,1
"845","M A, 2017, ","THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THE USE OF DISTRIBUTED VECTOR REPRESENTATIONS AND PATHFINDER NETWORK SCALING (PFNETS) TO REPRESENT ONLINE VACCINE CONTENT CREATED BY HEALTH EXPERTS AND BY LAYPEOPLE. BY ANALYZING A TARGET AUDIENCE'S CONCEPTUALIZATION OF A TOPIC, DOMAIN EXPERTS CAN DEVELOP TARGETED INTERVENTIONS TO IMPROVE THE BASIC HEALTH KNOWLEDGE OF CONSUMERS. THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTION IS THAT THE CONTENT CREATED BY DIFFERENT GROUPS REFLECTS THE MENTAL ORGANIZATION OF THEIR KNOWLEDGE. APPLYING AUTOMATED TEXT ANALYSIS TO THIS CONTENT MAY ELUCIDATE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE KNOWLEDGE STRUCTURES OF LAYPEOPLE (HEATH CONSUMERS) AND PROFESSIONALS (HEALTH EXPERTS). THIS PAPER UTILIZES VACCINE INFORMATION GENERATED BY LAYPEOPLE AND HEALTH EXPERTS TO INVESTIGATE THE UTILITY OF THIS APPROACH. WE USED AN ESTABLISHED TECHNIQUE FROM COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY, PATHFINDER NETWORK SCALING TO INFER THE STRUCTURE OF THE ASSOCIATIONAL NETWORKS BETWEEN CONCEPTS LEARNED FROM ONLINE CONTENT USING METHODS OF DISTRIBUTIONAL SEMANTICS. IN DOING SO, WE EXTEND THE ORIGINAL APPLICATION OF PFNETS TO INFER KNOWLEDGE STRUCTURES FROM INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPANTS, TO INFER THE PREVAILING KNOWLEDGE STRUCTURES WITHIN COMMUNITIES OF CONTENT AUTHORS. THE RESULTING GRAPHS REVEAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND VACCINATION EDUCATION EXPERTS TO IMPROVE COMMUNICATION AND INTERVENTION EFFORTS DIRECTED TOWARDS HEALTH CONSUMERS. OUR EFFORTS DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF USING AN AUTOMATED PROCEDURE TO EXAMINE THE MANIFESTATION OF CONCEPTUAL MODELS WITHIN LARGE BODIES OF FREE TEXT, REVEALING EVIDENCE OF CONFLICTING UNDERSTANDING OF VACCINE CONCEPTS AMONG HEALTH CONSUMERS AS COMPARED WITH HEALTH EXPERTS.

OBJECTIVE: WE AIMED TO DETERMINE IF AN AUTOMATED TEXT MINING METHOD COULD IDENTIFY ABUSE TYPES AND ANY INJURIES SUSTAINED BY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS IN NARRATIVES CONTAINED IN A LARGE POLICE DATASET FROM THE NEW SOUTH WALES POLICE FORCE. METHODS: WE USED A TRAINING SET OF 200 RECORDED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE EVENTS TO DESIGN A KNOWLEDGE-DRIVEN APPROACH BASED ON SYNTACTICAL PATTERNS IN THE TEXT AND THEN APPLIED THIS APPROACH TO A LARGE SET OF POLICE REPORTS. RESULTS: TESTING OUR APPROACH ON AN EVALUATION SET OF 100 DOMESTIC VIOLENCE EVENTS PROVIDED PRECISION VALUES OF 90.2% AND 85.0% FOR ABUSE TYPE AND VICTIM INJURIES, RESPECTIVELY. IN A SET OF 492,393 DOMESTIC VIOLENCE REPORTS, WE FOUND 71.32% (351,178) OF EVENTS WITH MENTIONS OF THE ABUSE TYPE(S) AND MORE THAN ONE-THIRD (177,117 EVENTS; 35.97%) CONTAINED VICTIM INJURIES. ""EMOTIONAL/VERBAL ABUSE"" (33.46%; 117,488) WAS THE MOST COMMON ABUSE TYPE, FOLLOWED BY ""PUNCHING"" (86,322 EVENTS; 24.58%) AND ""PROPERTY DAMAGE"" (22.27%; 78,203 EVENTS).

WE MEASURED THEMES AND FREQUENCY OF KEYWORDS RELATED TO INFECTION PREVENTION PRACTICES. WE PERFORMED A SENTIMENT ANALYSIS TO IDENTIFY THE SENTIMENT POLARITY AND PREDOMINANT EMOTIONS IN TWEETS AND CONDUCTED TOPIC MODELING TO IDENTIFY AND EXPLORE DISCUSSION TOPICS OVER TIME. WE COMPARED SENTIMENT, EMOTION, AND TOPICS AMONG THE MOST POPULAR TWEETS, DEFINED BY THE NUMBER OF RETWEETS. RESULTS: WE EVALUATED 126 049 TWEETS FROM 53 196 UNIQUE USERS. THE HOURLY NUMBER OF COVID-19-RELATED TWEETS STARKLY INCREASED FROM JANUARY 21, 2020 ONWARD. APPROXIMATELY HALF (49.5%) OF ALL TWEETS EXPRESSED FEAR AND APPROXIMATELY 30% EXPRESSED SURPRISE. IN THE FULL COHORT, THE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL IMPACT OF COVID-19 WAS THE MOST COMMONLY DISCUSSED TOPIC. WHEN FOCUSING ON THE MOST RETWEETED TWEETS, THE INCIDENCE OF FEAR DECREASED AND TOPICS FOCUSED ON QUARANTINE EFFORTS, THE OUTBREAK AND ITS TRANSMISSION, AS WELL AS PREVENTION.

THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT SCIENTIFIC DEBATE REGARDING THE ACCEPTABILITY OF SOME APPLICATIONS OF CRISPR/CAS, WITH LEADERS IN THE FIELD HIGHLIGHTING THE NEED FOR THE LAY PUBLIC'S VIEWS TO SHAPE EXPERT DISCUSSION. AS SUCH, WE SOUGHT TO DETERMINE THE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE PUBLIC OPINION ON GENE EDITING. WE CREATED A 17-ITEM ONLINE SURVEY TRANSLATED INTO 11 LANGUAGES AND ADVERTISED WORLDWIDE. TOPIC MODELING WAS USED TO ANALYZE TEXTUAL RESPONSES TO DETERMINE WHAT FACTORS INFLUENCED RESPONDENTS' OPINIONS TOWARD HUMAN SOMATIC OR EMBRYONIC GENE EDITING, AND HOW THIS VARIED AMONG RESPONDENTS WITH DIFFERING ATTITUDES AND DEMOGRAPHIC BACKGROUNDS. A TOTAL OF 3,988 FREE-TEXT RESPONSES WERE ANALYZED. RESPONDENTS HAD A MEAN AGE OF 32 (RANGE, 11-90) YEARS, AND 37% WERE FEMALE. THE MOST PREVALENT TOPICS CITED WERE FUTURE GENERATIONS, RESEARCH, HUMAN EDITING, CHILDREN, AND HEALTH. RESPONDENTS WHO DISAGREED WITH GENE EDITING FOR HEALTH-RELATED PURPOSES WERE MORE LIKELY TO CITE THE TOPIC BETTER UNDERSTANDING THAN THOSE WHO AGREED TO BOTH SOMATIC AND EMBRYONIC GENE EDITING. RESPONDENTS FROM WESTERN BACKGROUNDS MORE FREQUENTLY DISCUSSED FUTURE GENERATIONS, COMPARED WITH PARTICIPANTS FROM EASTERN COUNTRIES. RELIGIOUS RESPONDENTS DID NOT CITE THE TOPIC RELIGIOUS BELIEFS MORE FREQUENTLY THAN DID NONRELIGIOUS RESPONDENTS, WHEREAS CHRISTIAN RESPONDENTS WERE MORE LIKELY TO CITE THE TOPIC FUTURE GENERATIONS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT PUBLIC RESISTANCE TO HUMAN SOMATIC OR EMBRYONIC GENE EDITING DOES NOT STEM FROM AN INHERENT MISTRUST OF GENOME MODIFICATION, BUT RATHER A DESIRE FOR GREATER UNDERSTANDING. FURTHERMORE, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT FACTORS INFLUENCING PUBLIC OPINION VARY GREATLY AMONGST DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS.

MACHINE LEARNING METHODS WERE USED TO FILTER TWEETS WITH PERSONAL CONTENT, TO GEOLOCATE (TO THE USA) AND TO IDENTIFY CLUSTERS OF TWEETS WITH EMOTIONAL ELEMENTS. A SENTIMENT ANALYSIS WAS THEN APPLIED TO EACH CLUSTER. RESULTS: WE IDENTIFIED 46 407 TWEETS WITH EMOTIONAL ELEMENTS IN THE USA FROM WHICH 30 CLUSTERS WERE IDENTIFIED; 5 CLUSTERS (18% OF TWEETS) WERE RELATED TO INSULIN PRICING WITH BOTH POSITIVE EMOTIONS (JOY, LOVE) REFERRING TO ADVOCACY FOR AFFORDABLE INSULIN AND SADNESS EMOTIONS RELATED TO THE FRUSTRATION OF INSULIN PRICES, 5 CLUSTERS (12% OF TWEETS) TO SOLIDARITY AND SUPPORT WITH A MAJORITY OF JOY AND LOVE EMOTIONS EXPRESSED.

THIS PAPER PRESENTS OUR SECOND ATTEMPT TO DETERMINE THE ROLE OF COMPUTATIONAL ALGORITHMS IN UNDERSTANDING A SUICIDAL PATIENT'S THOUGHTS, AS REPRESENTED BY SUICIDE NOTES. WE FOCUS ON DEVELOPING METHODS OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING THAT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN GENUINE AND ELICITED SUICIDE NOTES. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS CAN CATEGORIZE SUICIDE NOTES AS WELL AS MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND PSYCHIATRIC PHYSICIAN TRAINEES DO. THE DATA USED ARE COMPRISED OF SUICIDE NOTES FROM 33 SUICIDE COMPLETERS AND MATCHED TO 33 ELICITED NOTES FROM HEALTHY CONTROL GROUP MEMBERS. ELEVEN MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND 31 PSYCHIATRIC TRAINEES WERE ASKED TO DECIDE IF A NOTE WAS GENUINE OR ELICITED. THEIR DECISIONS WERE COMPARED TO NINE DIFFERENT MACHINE-LEARNING ALGORITHMS. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT TRAINEES ACCURATELY CLASSIFIED NOTES 49% OF THE TIME, MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ACCURATELY CLASSIFIED NOTES 63% OF THE TIME, AND THE BEST MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM ACCURATELY CLASSIFIED THE NOTES 78% OF THE TIME. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN DEVELOPING AN EVIDENCE-BASED PREDICTOR OF REPEATED SUICIDE ATTEMPTS BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING CAN AID IN DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN CLASSES OF SUICIDAL NOTES.",0,1,0
"859","O B, 2020, ","OBJECTIVES: THE OBJECTIVE WAS TO ASSESS THE POSSIBILITY OF USING A COMBINATION OF OFFICIAL AND UNOFFICIAL FACEBOOK RATINGS AND COMMENTS AS A BASIS FOR NATION-WIDE HOSPITAL QUALITY ASSESSMENTS IN NORWAY. METHODS: ALL HOSPITALS FROM A NATIONAL CROSS-SECTIONAL PATIENT EXPERIENCE SURVEY IN 2015 WERE MATCHED WITH CORRESPONDING FACEBOOK RATINGS. FACEBOOK RATINGS WERE CORRELATED WITH BOTH CASE-MIX ADJUSTED AND UNADJUSTED PATIENT-REPORTED EXPERIENCE SCORES, WITH SEPARATE ANALYSIS FOR HOSPITALS WITH OFFICIAL SITE RATINGS AND HOSPITALS WITH UNOFFICIAL SITE RATINGS. FACEBOOK RATINGS WERE ALSO CORRELATED WITH PATIENT-REPORTED INCIDENT SCORES, HOSPITAL SIZE, 30-DAY MORTALITY AND 30-DAY READMISSION. FACEBOOK COMMENTS FROM 20 RANDOMLY SELECTED HOSPITALS WERE ANALYSED, CONTRASTING THE CONTENT AND SENTIMENTS OF OFFICIAL VERSUS UNOFFICIAL FACEBOOK PAGES. RESULTS: FACEBOOK RATINGS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH MOST PATIENT-REPORTED INDICATORS, WITH THE HIGHEST CORRELATIONS RELATING TO UNADJUSTED SCORES FOR ORGANISATION (0.60, P<0.000) AND NURSING SERVICES (0.57, P<0.000). FACEBOOK RATINGS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH HOSPITAL SIZE (-0.40, P=0.003) AND 30-DAY MORTALITY (0.31, P=0.040). SENTIMENT ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT 84.7% OF THE COMMENTS FROM UNOFFICIAL FACEBOOK SITES INCLUDED NEUTRAL COMMENTS THAT DID NOT GIVE ANY SPECIFIC DESCRIPTION OF EXPERIENCES OF THE QUALITY OF CARE AT THE HOSPITAL. CONTENT ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED COMMON THEMES ON OFFICIAL AND UNOFFICIAL FACEBOOK PAGES. CONCLUSIONS: FACEBOOK RATINGS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH PATIENT-REPORTED INDICATORS, HOSPITAL SIZE, AND 30-DAY MORTALITY. QUALITATIVE COMMENTS FROM OFFICIAL FACEBOOK ARE MORE RELEVANT FOR HOSPITAL EVALUATION THAN UNOFFICIAL SITES. MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED ON USING FACEBOOK RATINGS AS A STANDALONE INDICATOR OF PATIENT EXPERIENCES IN NATIONAL QUALITY MEASUREMENT, AND SUCH RATINGS SHOULD BE REPORTED TOGETHER WITH RESEARCH-BASED PATIENT EXPERIENCE INDICATORS AND WITH EXPLICIT CRITERIA FOR THE INCLUSION OF UNOFFICIAL SITES.",1,1,0

ALTHOUGH ADOLESCENTS WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER (ASD) ARE AT INCREASED RISK OF BOTH BULLYING AND SUICIDALITY, THERE IS VERY LITTLE RESEARCH THAT EXAMINES THE EXTENT TO WHICH AN EXPERIENCE OF BEING BULLIED MAY INCREASE SUICIDALITY WITHIN THIS SPECIFIC POPULATION. TO ADDRESS THIS, WE CONDUCTED A RETROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY TO INVESTIGATE THE LONGITUDINAL ASSOCIATION BETWEEN EXPERIENCING BULLYING AND SUICIDALITY IN A CLINICAL POPULATION OF 680 ADOLESCENTS WITH ASD. ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS OF ADOLESCENTS (13-17 YEARS), USING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN SOUTH LONDON, WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF ASD WERE ANALYZED. NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING WAS EMPLOYED TO IDENTIFY MENTIONS OF BULLYING AND SUICIDALITY IN THE FREE TEXT FIELDS OF ADOLESCENTS' CLINICAL RECORDS. COX REGRESSION ANALYSIS WAS EMPLOYED TO INVESTIGATE THE LONGITUDINAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BULLYING AND SUICIDALITY OUTCOMES. REPORTED EXPERIENCE OF BULLYING IN THE FIRST MONTH OF CLINICAL CONTACT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED RISK SUICIDALITY OVER THE FOLLOW-UP PERIOD (HAZARD RATIO = 1.82; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL = 1.28-2.59). IN ADDITION, FEMALE GENDER, PSYCHOSIS, AFFECTIVE DISORDER DIAGNOSES, AND HIGHER INTELLECTUAL ABILITY WERE ALL ASSOCIATED WITH SUICIDALITY AT FOLLOW-UP. THIS STUDY IS THE FIRST TO DEMONSTRATE THE STRENGTH OF LONGITUDINAL ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN BULLYING AND SUICIDALITY IN A CLINICAL POPULATION OF ADOLESCENTS WITH ASD, USING AUTOMATED APPROACHES TO DETECT KEY LIFE EVENTS WITHIN CLINICAL RECORDS.

THE LITERATURE IS UNCLEAR WHETHER LONELINESS DURING COVID-19 IS SIMILAR TO THOSE OF NON-PANDEMIC SEASONS. THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE EXPRESSION OF LONELINESS ON TWITTER DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC, AND IDENTIFIED KEY AREAS OF LONELINESS ACROSS DIVERSE COMMUNITIES. METHODS: TWITTER WAS SEARCHED FOR FEEDS THAT WERE:(1) IN ENGLISH; (2) POSTED FROM MAY 1, 2020 TO JULY 1, 2020; (3) POSTED BY INDIVIDUAL USERS (NOT ORGANISATIONS); AND (4) CONTAINED THE WORDS 'LONELINESS' AND 'COVID-19'. A MACHINE-LEARNING APPROACH (TOPIC MODELING) IDENTIFIED KEY TOPICS FROM THE TWITTER FEEDS; HIERARCHICAL MODELING IDENTIFIED OVERARCHING THEMES. VARIATIONS IN THE PREVALENCE OF THE THEMES WERE EXAMINED OVER TIME AND ACROSS THE NUMBER OF FOLLOWERS OF THE TWITTER USERS. RESULTS: 4492 TWITTER FEEDS WERE INCLUDED AND CLASSIFIED INTO 3 THEMES: (1) COMMUNITY IMPACT OF LONELINESS DURING COVID-19; (2) SOCIAL DISTANCING DURING COVID-19 AND ITS EFFECTS ON LONELINESS; AND (3) MENTAL HEALTH EFFECTS OF LONELINESS DURING COVID-19. THE 3 THEMES DEMONSTRATED TEMPORAL VARIATIONS. PARTICULARLY IN EUROPE, THEME 1 SHOWED A DRASTIC REDUCTION OVER TIME, WITH A CORRESPONDING RISE IN THEME 3. THE THEMES ALSO VARIED ACROSS NUMBER OF FOLLOWERS. HIGHLY INFLUENTIAL USERS WERE MORE LIKELY TO TALK ABOUT THEME 3 AND LESS ABOUT THEME 2. CONCLUSIONS: THE FINDINGS REFLECT CLOSE-TO-REAL-TIME PUBLIC SENTIMENTS ON LONELINESS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND DEMONSTRATED THE POTENTIAL USEFULNESS OF SOCIAL MEDIA TO KEEP TABS ON EVOLVING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES.

PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE ESTABLISHED COMFORT RANGES FOR THESE VARIABLES THROUGH INTERVIEWS AND QUESTIONNAIRES, REACHING ONLY LIMITED POPULATIONS. HOWEVER, LARGER AMOUNTS OF DATA WOULD NOT ONLY GENERATE MORE ROBUST RESULTS IN LOCAL STUDIES, BUT IT WOULD ALSO ALLOW FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF CREATING AN APPROACH THAT COULD BE APPLIED TO A WIDER RANGE OF WEATHER CONDITIONS AND DIFFERENT CLIMATES. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY DESCRIBES A NEW METHODOLOGY TO ASSESS PEOPLE'S PERCEPTION OF WEATHER BASED ON HUMAN RESPONSES TO WEATHER CONDITIONS EXTRACTED FROM TWEETS, WITH THE PURPOSE OF ESTABLISHING COMFORT RANGES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES. TWEETS CONTAINING WEATHER-ASSOCIATED KEYWORDS WERE COLLECTED, STORED, AND THEN LINKED TO REAL-TIME METEOROLOGICAL DATA ACQUIRED NEARBY THE LOCATIONS IN WHICH THE TWEETS WERE POSTED. AFTERWARDS, PEOPLE'S PERCEPTION OF WEATHER WAS EXTRACTED FROM THE TWEETS USING A CLASSIFIER TRAINED SPECIFICALLY ON WEATHER DATA THAT IDENTIFIED IRRELEVANT, NEUTRAL, POSITIVE, AND NEGATIVE TWEETS. THE OBTAINED TWEETS AND THEIR RELATED ATMOSPHERIC DATA WERE ANALYZED TO ESTABLISH COMFORT RANGES. THE TWEETS' RESPONSES TO EFFECTIVE TEMPERATURE WERE VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE OBTAINED IN PREVIOUS STUDIES, ALTHOUGH THE PEAK OF COMFORT IS SHIFTED TOWARDS THE COLD STRESS. SIMILARLY, THE TWEETS' RESPONSES TO THE THERMOHYGROMETRIC INDEX WERE ALIKE TO PREVIOUS RESULTS, BUT THE PEAK OF COMFORT IS SHIFTED TOWARDS THE HEAT STRESS. REGARDING THE SINGLE WEATHER VARIABLES UNDER STUDY, THE OBTAINED COMFORT RANGES ARE SIMILAR TO THE ONES FOUND IN PREVIOUS RESEARCH; IN PARTICULAR, THE TEMPERATURE COMFORT RANGE MATCHES PERFECTLY AT 20-22 C.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK WAS TO LEVERAGE INFORMATION EXTRACTED FROM LARGE DATABASES TO EVALUATE THE CONSISTENCY AND VALIDITY OF THESE SUBJECTIVE REPORTS, AND TO DETERMINE THEIR CORRELATION WITH THE REPORTED CULTIVARS AND WITH ESTIMATES OF THEIR CHEMICAL COMPOSITION (DELTA-9-THC, CBD, TERPENES). METHODS: WE ANALYZED A LARGE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATASET EXTRACTED FROM LEAFLY.COM WHERE USERS FREELY REPORTED THEIR EXPERIENCES WITH CANNABIS CULTIVARS, INCLUDING DIFFERENT SUBJECTIVE EFFECTS AND FLAVOUR ASSOCIATIONS. THIS ANALYSIS WAS COMPLEMENTED WITH INFORMATION ON THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF A SUBSET OF THE CULTIVARS EXTRACTED FROM PSILABS.ORG . THE STRUCTURE OF THIS DATASET WAS INVESTIGATED USING NETWORK ANALYSIS APPLIED TO THE PAIRWISE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN REPORTED SUBJECTIVE EFFECTS AND/OR CHEMICAL COMPOSITIONS. RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIERS WERE USED TO EVALUATE WHETHER REPORTS OF FLAVOURS AND SUBJECTIVE EFFECTS COULD IDENTIFY THE LABELLED SPECIES CULTIVAR. WE APPLIED NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) TOOLS TO FREE NARRATIVES WRITTEN BY THE USERS TO VALIDATE THE SUBJECTIVE EFFECT AND FLAVOUR TAGS. FINALLY, WE EXPLORED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TERPENOID CONTENT, CANNABINOID COMPOSITION AND SUBJECTIVE REPORTS IN A SUBSET OF THE CULTIVARS. RESULTS: MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFIERS DISTINGUISHED BETWEEN SPECIES TAGS GIVEN BY ""CANNABIS SATIVA"" AND ""CANNABIS INDICA"" BASED ON THE REPORTED FLAVOURS: <AUC> = 0.828 0.002 (P < 0.001); AND EFFECTS: <AUC> = 0.9965 0.0002 (P < 0.001). A SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TERPENE AND CANNABINOID CONTENT WAS SUGGESTED BY POSITIVE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN SUBJECTIVE EFFECT AND FLAVOUR TAGS (P < 0.05, FALSE-DISCOVERY-RATE (FDR)-CORRECTED); THESE CORRELATIONS CLUSTERED THE REPORTED EFFECTS INTO THREE GROUPS THAT REPRESENTED UNPLEASANT, STIMULANT AND SOOTHING EFFECTS. THE USE OF PREDEFINED TAGS WAS VALIDATED BY APPLYING LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS TOOLS TO UNSTRUCTURED WRITTEN REVIEWS, ALSO PROVIDING BREED-SPECIFIC TOPICS CONSISTENT WITH THEIR PURPORTED SUBJECTIVE EFFECTS. TERPENE PROFILES MATCHED THE PERCEPTUAL CHARACTERIZATIONS MADE BY THE USERS, PARTICULARLY FOR THE TERPENE-FLAVOURS GRAPH (Q = 0.324). CONCLUSIONS: OUR WORK REPRESENTS THE FIRST DATA-DRIVEN SYNTHESIS OF SELF-REPORTED AND CHEMICAL INFORMATION IN A LARGE NUMBER OF CANNABIS CULTIVARS. SINCE TERPENE CONTENT IS ROBUSTLY INHERITED AND LESS INFLUENCED BY ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, FLAVOUR PERCEPTION COULD REPRESENT A RELIABLE MARKER TO INDIRECTLY CHARACTERIZE THE PSYCHOACTIVE EFFECTS OF CANNABIS.

AS ONLINE COMMUNITIES GROW, THEY PLACE A GREATER BURDEN ON THEIR HUMAN MODERATORS, WHICH INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT PEOPLE AT RISK MAY BE OVERLOOKED. THIS STUDY EVALUATED THE POTENTIAL FOR MACHINE LEARNING TO ASSIST ONLINE PEER SUPPORT BY DIRECTING MODERATORS' ATTENTION WHERE IT IS MOST NEEDED. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMED TO EVALUATE THE ACCURACY OF AN AUTOMATED TRIAGE SYSTEM AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT INFLUENCES MODERATOR BEHAVIOR. METHODS: A MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFIER WAS TRAINED TO PRIORITIZE FORUM MESSAGES AS GREEN, AMBER, RED, OR CRISIS DEPENDING ON HOW URGENTLY THEY REQUIRE ATTENTION FROM A MODERATOR. THIS WAS THEN LAUNCHED AS A SET OF WIDGETS INJECTED INTO A POPULAR ONLINE PEER SUPPORT FORUM HOSTED BY REACHOUT.COM, AN AUSTRALIAN WEB-BASED YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE THAT AIMS TO INTERVENE EARLY IN THE ONSET OF MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS IN YOUNG PEOPLE. THE ACCURACY OF THE SYSTEM WAS EVALUATED USING A HOLDOUT TEST SET OF MANUALLY PRIORITIZED MESSAGES. THE IMPACT ON MODERATOR BEHAVIOR WAS MEASURED AS RESPONSE RATIO AND RESPONSE LATENCY, THAT IS, THE PROPORTION OF MESSAGES THAT RECEIVE AT LEAST ONE REPLY FROM A MODERATOR AND HOW LONG IT TOOK FOR THESE REPLIES TO BE MADE. THESE MEASURES WERE COMPARED ACROSS 3 PERIODS: BEFORE LAUNCH, AFTER AN INFORMAL LAUNCH, AND AFTER A FORMAL LAUNCH ACCOMPANIED BY TRAINING. RESULTS: THE ALGORITHM ACHIEVED 84% F-MEASURE IN IDENTIFYING CONTENT THAT REQUIRED A MODERATOR RESPONSE. BETWEEN PRELAUNCH AND POST-TRAINING PERIODS, RESPONSE RATIOS INCREASED BY 0.9, 4.4, AND 10.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS FOR MESSAGES LABELLED AS CRISIS, RED, AND GREEN, RESPECTIVELY, BUT DECREASED BY 5.0 PERCENTAGE POINTS FOR AMBER MESSAGES. LOGISTIC REGRESSION INDICATED THAT THE TRIAGE SYSTEM WAS A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTOR TO RESPONSE RATIOS FOR GREEN, AMBER, AND RED MESSAGES, BUT NOT FOR CRISIS MESSAGES. RESPONSE LATENCY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED (P<.001), BETWEEN THE SAME PERIODS, BY FACTORS OF 80%, 80%, 77%, AND 12% FOR CRISIS, RED, AMBER, AND GREEN MESSAGES, RESPECTIVELY. REGRESSION ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT THE TRIAGE SYSTEM MADE A SIGNIFICANT AND UNIQUE CONTRIBUTION TO REDUCING THE TIME TAKEN TO RESPOND TO GREEN, AMBER, AND RED MESSAGES, BUT NOT TO CRISIS MESSAGES, AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR MODERATOR AND COMMUNITY ACTIVITY. CONCLUSIONS: THE TRIAGE SYSTEM WAS GENERALLY ACCURATE, AND MODERATORS WERE LARGELY IN AGREEMENT WITH HOW MESSAGES WERE PRIORITIZED. IT HAD A MODEST EFFECT ON RESPONSE RATIOS, PRIMARILY BECAUSE MODERATORS WERE ALREADY MORE LIKELY TO RESPOND TO HIGH PRIORITY CONTENT BEFORE THE INTRODUCTION OF TRIAGE. HOWEVER, IT SIGNIFICANTLY AND SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED THE TIME TAKEN FOR MODERATORS TO RESPOND TO PRIORITIZED CONTENT. FURTHER EVALUATIONS ARE NEEDED TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF MISTAKES MADE BY THE TRIAGE ALGORITHM AND HOW CHANGES TO MODERATOR RESPONSIVENESS IMPACT THE WELL-BEING OF FORUM MEMBERS.",1,1,1

AN ACT-R BASED BAYESIAN MODEL AND A RANDOM PERMUTATION VECTOR-BASED MODEL WERE TESTED ON THE LARGE DATA SETS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT PAST USER BEHAVIOR OF TAG USE IS A STRONG PREDICTOR OF FUTURE BEHAVIOR. FURTHERMORE, PAST BEHAVIOR WAS SUCCESSFULLY INCORPORATED INTO THE RANDOM PERMUTATION MODEL THAT PREVIOUSLY USED ONLY CONTEXT. ALSO, ACT-R'S ATTENTIONAL WEIGHT TERM WAS LINKED TO AN ENTROPY-WEIGHTING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING METHOD USED TO ATTENUATE HIGH-FREQUENCY WORDS (E.G., ARTICLES AND PREPOSITIONS). WORD ORDER WAS NOT FOUND TO BE A STRONG PREDICTOR OF TAG USE, AND THE RANDOM PERMUTATION MODEL PERFORMED COMPARABLY TO THE BAYESIAN MODEL WITHOUT INCLUDING WORD ORDER. THIS SHOWS THAT THE STRENGTH OF THE RANDOM PERMUTATION MODEL IS NOT IN THE ABILITY TO REPRESENT WORD ORDER, BUT RATHER IN THE WAY IN WHICH CONTEXT INFORMATION IS SUCCESSFULLY COMPRESSED. THE RESULTS OF THE LARGE-SCALE EXPLORATION SHOW HOW THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE 2 MEMORY MODELS CAN BE MODIFIED TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE ACCURACY, AND MAY SUGGEST TASK-INDEPENDENT GENERAL MODIFICATIONS THAT CAN HELP IMPROVE MODEL FIT TO HUMAN DATA IN A MUCH WIDER RANGE OF DOMAINS.

OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO CHARACTERIZE THE FREQUENCY AND CONTENT OF POSTS REGARDING SUBSTANCE USE IN THE YEAR BEFORE PREGNANCY AND DURING PREGNANCY AMONG YOUNG MOTHERS. METHODS: FACEBOOK POSTS WERE MINED FROM YOUNG PREGNANT WOMEN (AGE, 16-24 YEARS) WHO CONSENTED FROM 2 MIDWEST PRIMARY CARE CLINICS THAT SERVE A PREDOMINANTLY LOW-INCOME COMMUNITY. NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING WAS USED TO IDENTIFY POSTS RELATED TO SUBSTANCE USE BY KEYWORD SEARCHING (EG, DRUNK, DRUGS, POT, AND METH). USING MIXED-METHODS TECHNIQUES, 2 INVESTIGATORS ITERATIVELY CODED AND IDENTIFIED MAJOR THEMES AROUND SUBSTANCE USE FROM THESE MINED FACEBOOK POSTS. OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDE THE FREQUENCY OF POSTS AND MAJOR THEMES EXPRESSED REGARDING SUBSTANCE USE BEFORE AND DURING PREGNANCY. RESULTS: WOMEN IN OUR SAMPLE (N=43) HAD A MEAN AGE OF 21 (SD 2.3) YEARS, AND THE LARGEST SUBGROUP (21/43, 49%) IDENTIFIED AS NON-HISPANIC BLACK; 26% (11/43) IDENTIFIED AS NON-HISPANIC WHITE; 16% (7/43) AS HISPANIC; AND 9% (4/43) AS NON-HISPANIC MIXED RACE, NATIVE AMERICAN, OR OTHER. THE LARGEST SUBGROUP (20/43, 47%) GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL WITHOUT FURTHER EDUCATION, WHILE 30% (13/43) COMPLETED ONLY SOME HIGH SCHOOL AND 23% (10/43) COMPLETED AT LEAST SOME POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION. YOUNG WOMEN DISCUSSED SUBSTANCE USE ON SOCIAL MEDIA BEFORE AND DURING PREGNANCY, ALTHOUGH COMPARED WITH THE YEAR BEFORE PREGNANCY, THE AVERAGE FREQUENCY OF SUBSTANCE-RELATED POSTS DURING PREGNANCY DECREASED. THEMES IDENTIFIED INCLUDED CRAVING ALCOHOL OR MARIJUANA, SOCIAL USE OF ALCOHOL OR MARIJUANA, REASONS FOR ABSTAINING FROM SUBSTANCE USE, AND INTOXICATION.

METHODS: A TOTAL OF 426 ARTICLES PUBLISHED BETWEEN 2000 AND 2018 WERE RETRIEVED FROM THE CLARIVATE ANALYTICS WEB OF SCIENCE, AND THEN, COMPUTER-AIDED BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS AS WELL AS LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION (LDA) TOPIC MODELING WERE CONDUCTED ON THE COLLECTION OF THE DATA. RESULTS: DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS ON THE INCREASING NUMBER OF PUBLICATIONS, NETWORK ANALYSIS OF SCIENTIFIC COLLABORATION BETWEEN COUNTRIES, WORD CO-OCCURRENCE ANALYSIS, CONCEPTUAL STRUCTURE, AND SIX LATENT TOPICS (K = 6) IDENTIFIED ARE DISCUSSED. CONCLUSIONS: PREVENTING OR MANAGING DEPRESSION AMONG CAREGIVERS IS A GROWING FIELD WITH THE HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR THE AGING POPULATION. IN THE FUTURE, COLLABORATING BETWEEN COUNTRIES AND REFLECTING CULTURAL BACKGROUNDS IN CAREGIVER DEPRESSION RESEARCH ARE NEEDED. THIS STUDY IS EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE FIELD OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS OF CAREGIVERS IN LOOKING A BIG PICTURE OF THE CURRENT POSITION THROUGH DATA-DRIVEN ANALYSIS AND MOVING FORWARD TOWARDS A BETTER DIRECTION.",0,1,1
"911","R I, 2016, -a","PEOPLE USE MORE POSITIVE WORDS THAN NEGATIVE WORDS. REFERRED TO AS ""LINGUISTIC POSITIVITY BIAS"" (LPB), THIS EFFECT HAS BEEN FOUND ACROSS CULTURES AND LANGUAGES, PROMPTING THE CONCLUSION THAT IT IS A PANHUMAN TENDENCY. HOWEVER, ALTHOUGH MULTIPLE COMPETING EXPLANATIONS OF LPB HAVE BEEN PROPOSED, THERE IS STILL NO CONSENSUS ON WHAT MECHANISM(S) GENERATE LPB OR EVEN ON WHETHER IT IS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY UNIVERSAL COGNITIVE FEATURES OR BY ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS. IN THIS WORK WE PROPOSE THAT LPB HAS REMAINED UNRESOLVED BECAUSE PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS NEGLECTED AN ESSENTIAL DIMENSION OF LANGUAGE: TIME. IN FOUR STUDIES CONDUCTED WITH TWO INDEPENDENT, TIME-STAMPED TEXT CORPORA (GOOGLE BOOKS NGRAMS AND THE NEW YORK TIMES), WE FOUND THAT LPB IN AMERICAN ENGLISH HAS DECREASED DURING THE LAST TWO CENTURIES. WE ALSO OBSERVED DYNAMIC FLUCTUATIONS IN LPB THAT WERE PREDICTED BY CHANGES IN OBJECTIVE ENVIRONMENT, I.E., WAR AND ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS, AND BY CHANGES IN NATIONAL SUBJECTIVE HAPPINESS. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING EVIDENCE THAT LPB IS A DYNAMIC PHENOMENON, THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT COGNITIVE MECHANISMS ALONE CANNOT ACCOUNT FOR THE OBSERVED DYNAMIC FLUCTUATIONS IN LPB. AT THE LEAST, LPB LIKELY ARISES FROM MULTIPLE INTERACTING MECHANISMS INVOLVING SUBJECTIVE, OBJECTIVE, AND SOCIETAL FACTORS. IN ADDITION TO HAVING THEORETICAL SIGNIFICANCE, OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THE VALUE OF NEWLY AVAILABLE DATA SOURCES IN ADDRESSING LONG-STANDING SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS.",0,1,1
"912","R N, 2014, ","BACKGROUND: TWITTER HAS SHOWN SOME USEFULNESS IN PREDICTING INFLUENZA CASES ON A WEEKLY BASIS IN MULTIPLE COUNTRIES AND ON DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIC SCALES. RECENTLY, BRONIATOWSKI AND COLLEAGUES SUGGESTED TWITTER'S RELEVANCE AT THE CITY-LEVEL FOR NEW YORK CITY. HERE, WE LOOK TO DIVE DEEPER INTO THE CASE OF NEW YORK CITY BY ANALYZING DAILY TWITTER DATA FROM TEMPORAL AND SPATIOTEMPORAL PERSPECTIVES. ALSO, THROUGH MANUAL CODING OF ALL TWEETS, WE LOOK TO GAIN QUALITATIVE INSIGHTS THAT CAN HELP DIRECT FUTURE AUTOMATED SEARCHES. OBJECTIVE: THE INTENT OF THE STUDY WAS FIRST TO VALIDATE THE TEMPORAL PREDICTIVE STRENGTH OF DAILY TWITTER DATA FOR INFLUENZA-LIKE ILLNESS EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ILI-ED) VISITS DURING THE NEW YORK CITY 2012-2013 INFLUENZA SEASON AGAINST OTHER AVAILABLE AND ESTABLISHED DATASETS (GOOGLE SEARCH QUERY, OR GSQ), AND SECOND, TO EXAMINE THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION AND THE SPREAD OF GEOCODED TWEETS AS PROXIES FOR POTENTIAL CASES. METHODS: FROM THE TWITTER STREAMING API, 2972 TWEETS WERE COLLECTED IN THE NEW YORK CITY REGION MATCHING THE KEYWORDS ""FLU"", ""INFLUENZA"", ""GRIPE"", AND ""HIGH FEVER"". THE TWEETS WERE CATEGORIZED ACCORDING TO THE SCHEME DEVELOPED BY LAMB ET AL. A NEW FOURTH CATEGORY WAS ADDED AS AN EVALUATOR GUESS FOR THE PROBABILITY OF THE SUBJECT(S) BEING SICK TO ACCOUNT FOR STRENGTH OF CONFIDENCE IN THE VALIDITY OF THE STATEMENT. TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS WERE MADE FOR TWEETS AGAINST DAILY ILI-ED VISITS AND DAILY GSQ VOLUME. THE BEST MODELS WERE USED FOR LINEAR REGRESSION FOR FORECASTING ILI VISITS. A WEIGHTED, RETROSPECTIVE POISSON MODEL WITH SATSCAN SOFTWARE (N=1484), AND VECTOR MAP WERE USED FOR SPATIOTEMPORAL ANALYSIS. RESULTS: INFECTION-RELATED TWEETS (R=.763) CORRELATED BETTER THAN GSQ TIME SERIES (R=.683) FOR THE SAME KEYWORDS AND HAD A LOWER MEAN AVERAGE PERCENT ERROR (8.4 VS 11.8) FOR ILI-ED VISIT PREDICTION IN JANUARY, THE MOST VOLATILE MONTH OF FLU. SATSCAN IDENTIFIED PRIMARY OUTBREAK CLUSTER OF HIGH-PROBABILITY INFECTION TWEETS WITH A 2.74 RELATIVE RISK RATIO COMPARED TO MEDIUM-PROBABILITY INFECTION TWEETS AT P=.001 IN NORTHERN BROOKLYN, IN A RADIUS THAT INCLUDES BARCLAY'S CENTER AND THE ATLANTIC AVENUE TERMINAL. CONCLUSIONS: WHILE OTHERS HAVE LOOKED AT WEEKLY REGIONAL TWEETS, THIS STUDY IS THE FIRST TO STRESS TEST TWITTER FOR DAILY CITY-LEVEL DATA FOR NEW YORK CITY. EXTRACTION OF PERSONAL TESTIMONIES OF INFECTION-RELATED TWEETS SUGGESTS TWITTER'S STRENGTH BOTH QUALITATIVELY AND QUANTITATIVELY FOR ILI-ED PREDICTION COMPARED TO ALTERNATIVE DAILY DATASETS MIXED WITH AWARENESS-BASED DATA SUCH AS GSQ. ADDITIONALLY, GRANULAR TWITTER DATA PROVIDE IMPORTANT SPATIOTEMPORAL INSIGHTS.

"913","MS K, 2017, ","BACKGROUND: VIRTUAL REALITY (VR) TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES AN IMMERSIVE ENVIRONMENT THAT ENABLES USERS TO HAVE MODIFIED EXPERIENCES OF REALITY. VR IS INCREASINGLY USED TO MANAGE PATIENTS WITH PAIN, DISABILITY, OBESITY, NEUROLOGIC DYSFUNCTION, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION. HOWEVER, PUBLIC OPINION REGARDING THE USE OF VR IN HEALTH CARE HAS NOT BEEN EXPLORED. UNDERSTANDING PUBLIC OPINION OF VR IS CRITICAL TO ENSURING EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS EMERGING TECHNOLOGY. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMED TO EXAMINE PUBLIC OPINION ABOUT HEALTH CARE VR USING SOCIAL LISTENING, A METHOD THAT ALLOWS FOR THE EXPLORATION OF UNFILTERED VIEWS OF TOPICS DISCUSSED ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND ONLINE FORUMS. METHODS: IN MARCH 2016, NBC NEWS PRODUCED A VIDEO DEPICTING THE USE OF VR FOR PATIENT CARE. THE VIDEO WAS REPACKAGED BY NOWTHIS, A SOCIAL MEDIA NEWS WEBSITE, AND DISTRIBUTED ON FACEBOOK BY UPWORTHY, A NEWS AGGREGATOR, YIELDING 4.3 MILLION VIEWS AND 2401 COMMENTS. WE USED MICROSOFT EXCEL POWER QUERY AND ATLAS.TI SOFTWARE (VERSION 7.5, SCIENTIFIC SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT) TO ANALYZE THE COMMENTS USING CONTENT ANALYSIS AND CATEGORIZED THE COMMENTS AROUND FIRST-, SECOND-, AND THIRD-ORDER CONCEPTS. WE DETERMINED SELF-IDENTIFIED GENDER FROM THE USER'S FACEBOOK PAGE AND PERFORMED SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF THE LANGUAGE TO ANALYZE WHETHER THE PERCEPTION OF VR DIFFERED BY GENDER USING A PEARSON'S CHI-SQUARE TEST. RESULTS: OUT OF THE 1614 ANALYZABLE COMMENTS, 1021 (63.26%) WERE ATTRIBUTED TO FEMALE FACEBOOK USERS, 572 (35.44%) TO MALE USERS, AND 21 (1.30%) TO USERS OF UNKNOWN GENDER. THERE WERE 1197 COMMENTS CODED AS EXPRESSING A POSITIVE PERCEPTION ABOUT VR (74.16%), 251 CODED AS EXPRESSING A NEGATIVE PERCEPTION AND/OR CONCERN (15.56%), AND 560 CODED AS NEUTRAL (34.70%). INFORMANTS IDENTIFIED 20 USE CASES FOR VR IN HEALTH CARE, INCLUDING THE USE OF VR FOR PAIN AND STRESS REDUCTION; BED-BOUND INDIVIDUALS; WOMEN DURING LABOR; AND PATIENTS UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY, DIALYSIS, RADIATION, OR IMAGING PROCEDURES. NEGATIVE COMMENTS EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT RADIATION, INFECTION RISK, MOTION SICKNESS, AND THE UBIQUITY OF AND OVERALL DEPENDENCE ON TECHNOLOGY. THERE WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE LANGUAGE VALENCE OF THE FACEBOOK POST AND THE GENDER OF THE FACEBOOK USER; MEN WERE MORE LIKELY TO POST NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS ABOUT THE USE OF VR FOR HEALTH CARE, WHEREAS WOMEN WERE MORE LIKELY TO POST POSITIVE PERCEPTIONS (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: MOST INFORMANTS EXPRESSED POSITIVE PERCEPTIONS ABOUT THE USE OF VR IN A WIDE RANGE OF HEALTH CARE SETTINGS. HOWEVER, MANY EXPRESSED CONCERNS THAT SHOULD BE ACKNOWLEDGED AND ADDRESSED AS HEALTH CARE VR CONTINUES TO EVOLVE. OUR RESULTS PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN DETERMINING WHERE FURTHER RESEARCH ON THE USE OF VR IN PATIENT CARE IS NEEDED, AND OFFER A FORMAL OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC OPINION TO SHAPE THE VR RESEARCH AGENDA.",1,1,1

WHILE MEDICAL EVIDENCE IS BEING GENERATED, SOCIAL MEDIA SURVEILLANCE OFFERS A FAST AND INEXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVE TO TRADITIONAL SURVEYS IN ASCERTAINING PERCEIVED THERAPEUTIC PURPOSES AND MODES OF CONSUMPTION FOR CBD PRODUCTS. METHODS: WE COLLECTED ALL COMMENTS FROM THE CBD SUBREDDIT POSTED BETWEEN JANUARY 1 AND APRIL 30, 2019 AS WELL AS COMMENTS SUBMITTED TO THE FDA REGARDING REGULATION OF CANNABIS-DERIVED PRODUCTS AND ANALYZED THEM USING A RULE-BASED LANGUAGE PROCESSING METHOD. A RELATIVE RANKING OF POPULAR THERAPEUTIC USES AND PRODUCT GROUPS FOR CBD IS OBTAINED BASED ON FREQUENCY OF PATTERN MATCHES INCLUDING PRECISE QUERIES THAT ENTAIL IDENTIFYING MENTIONS OF THE CONDITION, A CBD PRODUCT, AND SOME ""TRIGGER"" PHRASE INDICATING THERAPEUTIC USE. WE VALIDATED THE SOCIAL MEDIA-BASED FINDINGS USING A SIMILAR ANALYSIS ON COMMENTS TO THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION'S (FDA) 2019 REQUEST-FOR-COMMENTS ON CANNABIS-DERIVED PRODUCTS. RESULTS: CBD IS MOSTLY DISCUSSED AS A REMEDY FOR ANXIETY DISORDERS AND PAIN AND THIS IS CONSISTENT ACROSS BOTH COMMENT SOURCES. OF COMMENTS POSTED TO THE CBD SUBREDDIT DURING THE MONITORED TIME SPAN, 6.19% MENTIONED ANXIETY AT LEAST ONCE WITH AT LEAST 6.02% OF THESE COMMENTS SPECIFICALLY MENTIONING CBD AS A TREATMENT FOR ANXIETY (I.E., 0.37% OF TOTAL COMMENTS). THE MOST POPULAR CBD PRODUCT GROUP IS OIL AND TINCTURES. CONCLUSION: SOCIAL MEDIA SURVEILLANCE OF CBD USAGE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SURFACE NEW THERAPEUTIC USE-CASES AS THEY ARE POSTED. CONTEMPORARY SOCIAL MEDIA DATA INDICATE, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT STRESS AND NAUSEA ARE FREQUENTLY MENTIONED AS THERAPEUTIC USE CASES FOR CBD WITHOUT CORRESPONDING EVIDENCE, THAT AFFIRMS OR DENIES, IN THE RESEARCH LITERATURE. HOWEVER, THE ABUNDANCE OF ANECDOTAL CLAIMS WARRANTS SERIOUS SCIENTIFIC EXPLORATION MOVING FORWARD.

NOT MUCH IS KNOWN ABOUT THE TOPICS BEING SHARED ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS RELATING TO COVID-19. ANALYZING SUCH INFORMATION CAN HELP POLICY MAKERS AND HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATIONS ASSESS THE NEEDS OF THEIR STAKEHOLDERS AND ADDRESS THEM APPROPRIATELY. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMS TO IDENTIFY THE MAIN TOPICS POSTED BY TWITTER USERS RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. METHODS: LEVERAGING A SET OF TOOLS (TWITTER'S SEARCH APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE (API), TWEEPY PYTHON LIBRARY, AND POSTGRESQL DATABASE) AND USING A SET OF PREDEFINED SEARCH TERMS (""CORONA,"" ""2019-NCOV,"" AND ""COVID-19""), WE EXTRACTED THE TEXT AND METADATA (NUMBER OF LIKES AND RETWEETS, AND USER PROFILE INFORMATION INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF FOLLOWERS) OF PUBLIC ENGLISH LANGUAGE TWEETS FROM FEBRUARY 2, 2020, TO MARCH 15, 2020. WE ANALYZED THE COLLECTED TWEETS USING WORD FREQUENCIES OF SINGLE (UNIGRAMS) AND DOUBLE WORDS (BIGRAMS). WE LEVERAGED LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION FOR TOPIC MODELING TO IDENTIFY TOPICS DISCUSSED IN THE TWEETS. WE ALSO PERFORMED SENTIMENT ANALYSIS AND EXTRACTED THE MEAN NUMBER OF RETWEETS, LIKES, AND FOLLOWERS FOR EACH TOPIC AND CALCULATED THE INTERACTION RATE PER TOPIC. RESULTS: OUT OF APPROXIMATELY 2.8 MILLION TWEETS INCLUDED, 167,073 UNIQUE TWEETS FROM 160,829 UNIQUE USERS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. OUR ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED 12 TOPICS, WHICH WERE GROUPED INTO FOUR MAIN THEMES: ORIGIN OF THE VIRUS; ITS SOURCES; ITS IMPACT ON PEOPLE, COUNTRIES, AND THE ECONOMY; AND WAYS OF MITIGATING THE RISK OF INFECTION. THE MEAN SENTIMENT WAS POSITIVE FOR 10 TOPICS AND NEGATIVE FOR 2 TOPICS (DEATHS CAUSED BY COVID-19 AND INCREASED RACISM). THE MEAN FOR TWEET TOPICS OF ACCOUNT FOLLOWERS RANGED FROM 2722 (INCREASED RACISM) TO 13,413 (ECONOMIC LOSSES). THE HIGHEST MEAN OF LIKES FOR THE TWEETS WAS 15.4 (ECONOMIC LOSS), WHILE THE LOWEST WAS 3.94 (TRAVEL BANS AND WARNINGS). CONCLUSIONS: PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS RESPONSE ACTIVITIES ON THE GROUND AND ONLINE ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY SIMULTANEOUS AND INTERTWINED. SOCIAL MEDIA PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO DIRECTLY COMMUNICATE HEALTH INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC. HEALTH SYSTEMS SHOULD WORK ON BUILDING NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL DISEASE DETECTION AND SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS THROUGH MONITORING SOCIAL MEDIA.

"916","L J, 2020, ","OBJECTIVE: CLINICIAN NARRATIVE STYLE IN ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHR) HAS RARELY BEEN INVESTIGATED. CLINICIANS SOMETIMES RECORD BRIEF QUOTATIONS FROM PATIENTS, POSSIBLY MORE FREQUENTLY WHEN HIGHER RISK IS PERCEIVED. WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER THE FREQUENCY OF QUOTED PHRASES IN AN EHR WAS HIGHER IN TIME PERIODS CLOSER TO A SUICIDE ATTEMPT. DESIGN: A CASE-CROSSOVER STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN A LARGE MENTAL HEALTH RECORDS DATABASE. A NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TOOL WAS DEVELOPED USING REGULAR EXPRESSION MATCHING TO IDENTIFY TEXT OCCURRING WITHIN QUOTATION MARKS IN THE EHR. SETTING: ELECTRONIC RECORDS FROM A LARGE MENTAL HEALTHCARE PROVIDER SERVING A GEOGRAPHIC CATCHMENT OF 1.3 MILLION RESIDENTS IN SOUTH LONDON WERE LINKED WITH HOSPITALISATION DATA. PARTICIPANTS: 1503 INDIVIDUALS WERE IDENTIFIED AS HAVING A HOSPITALISED SUICIDE ATTEMPT FROM 1 APRIL 2006 TO 31 MARCH 2017 WITH AT LEAST ONE DOCUMENT IN BOTH THE CASE PERIOD (1-30 DAYS PRIOR TO ADMISSION) AND THE CONTROL PERIOD (61-90 DAYS PRIOR TO ADMISSION). OUTCOME MEASURES: THE NUMBER OF QUOTED PHRASES IN THE CONTROL AS COMPARED WITH THE CASE PERIOD. RESULTS: BOTH ATTENDED (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02 TO 1.08) AND NON-ATTENDED (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.04 TO 1.26) CLINICAL APPOINTMENTS WERE INDEPENDENTLY HIGHER IN THE CASE COMPARED WITH CONTROL PERIOD, WHILE THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN MENTAL HEALTHCARE HOSPITALISATION (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 TO 1.01). IN ADDITION, THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN THE LEVELS OF QUOTED TEXT BETWEEN THE COMPARISON TIME PERIODS (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.91 TO 1.30). CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED AN ALGORITHM TO IDENTIFY QUOTED SPEECH IN TEXT FIELDS FROM ROUTINE MENTAL HEALTHCARE RECORDS. CONTRARY TO THE HYPOTHESIS, NO ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THIS EXPOSURE AND PROXIMITY TO A SUICIDE ATTEMPT WAS FOUND; HOWEVER, FURTHER EVALUATION IS WARRANTED ON THE WAY IN WHICH CLINICIAN-PERCEIVED RISK MIGHT BE FEASIBLY CHARACTERISED FROM CLINICAL TEXT.",0,1,0

UNDERSTANDING OF COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES ACROSS DIFFERENT PHAS AND EXAMINING THE PUBLIC RESPONSE ON THE SOCIAL MEDIA LANDSCAPES CAN HELP IMPROVE PRACTICES FOR DISSEMINATING INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMS TO EXAMINE COVID-19-RELATED OUTREACH EFFORTS OF PHAS IN SINGAPORE, THE UNITED STATES, AND ENGLAND, AND THE CORRESPONDING PUBLIC RESPONSE TO THESE OUTREACH EFFORTS ON FACEBOOK. METHODS: POSTS AND COMMENTS FROM THE FACEBOOK PAGES OF THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH (MOH) IN SINGAPORE, THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC) IN THE UNITED STATES, AND PUBLIC HEALTH ENGLAND (PHE) IN ENGLAND WERE EXTRACTED FROM JANUARY 1, 2019, TO MARCH 18, 2020. POSTS PUBLISHED BEFORE JANUARY 1, 2020, WERE CATEGORIZED AS PRE-COVID-19, WHILE THE REMAINING POSTS WERE CATEGORIZED AS PERI-COVID-19 POSTS. COVID-19-RELATED POSTS WERE IDENTIFIED AND CLASSIFIED INTO THEMES. METRICS USED FOR MEASURING OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT WERE FREQUENCY, MEAN POSTS PER DAY (PPD), MEAN REACTIONS PER POST, MEAN SHARES PER POST, AND MEAN COMMENTS PER POST. RESPONSES TO THE COVID-19 POSTS WERE MEASURED USING FREQUENCY, MEAN SENTIMENT POLARITY, POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE SENTIMENTS RATIO (PNSR), AND POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE EMOTIONS RATIO (PNER). TOXICITY IN COMMENTS WERE IDENTIFIED AND ANALYZED USING FREQUENCY, MEAN LIKES PER TOXIC COMMENT, AND MEAN REPLIES PER TOXIC COMMENT. TREND ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED TO EXAMINE HOW THE METRICS VARIED WITH KEY EVENTS SUCH AS WHEN COVID-19 WAS DECLARED A PANDEMIC. RESULTS: THE MOH PUBLISHED MORE COVID-19 POSTS (N=271; MEAN PPD 5.0) COMPARED TO THE CDC (N=94; MEAN PPD 2.2) AND PHE (N=45; MEAN PPD 1.4). THE MEAN NUMBER OF COMMENTS PER COVID-19 POST WAS HIGHEST FOR THE CDC (MEAN CPP 255.3) COMPARED TO THE MOH (MEAN CPP 15.6) AND PHE (MEAN CPP 12.5). SIX MAJOR THEMES WERE IDENTIFIED, WITH POSTS ABOUT PREVENTION AND SAFETY MEASURES AND SITUATION UPDATES BEING PREVALENT ACROSS THE THREE PHAS. THE THEMES OF THE MOH'S POSTS WERE DIVERSE, WHILE THE CDC AND PHE POSTS FOCUSED ON A FEW THEMES. OVERALL, RESPONSE SENTIMENTS FOR THE MOH POSTS (PNSR 0.94) WERE MORE FAVORABLE COMPARED TO RESPONSE SENTIMENTS FOR THE CDC (PNSR 0.57) AND PHE (PNSR 0.55) POSTS. TOXIC COMMENTS WERE RARE (0.01%) ACROSS ALL PHAS. CONCLUSIONS: PHAS' EXTENT OF FACEBOOK USE FOR OUTREACH PURPOSES DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC VARIED AMONG THE THREE PHAS, HIGHLIGHTING THE STRATEGIES AND APPROACHES THAT OTHER PHAS CAN POTENTIALLY ADOPT.

WE POSTED OUR SURVEY ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK, AND NEXTDOOR ON MARCH 14TH TO MARCH 23RD THAT INCLUDED 21 QUESTIONS INCLUDING DEMOGRAPHICS, IMPACT ON DAILY LIFE, ACTIONS TAKEN, AND DIFFICULTIES FACED. WE ANALYZED THE FREE-TEXT RESPONSES TO THE IMPACT QUESTION USING LIWC, A COMPUTATIONAL NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TOOL, AND PERFORMED A THEMATIC CONTENT ANALYSIS OF THE REASONS PEOPLE GAVE FOR NON-COMPLIANCE WITH SOCIAL DISTANCING ORDERS. STANFORD UNIVERSITYS IRB APPROVED THE STUDY. IN 9 DAYS, WE COLLECTED A TOTAL OF 20,734 RESPONSES. 6,573 INDIVIDUALS PROVIDED A RESPONSE (30 WORDS) TO THE QUESTION, TELL US HOW THE CORONAVIRUS CRISIS IS IMPACTING YOUR LIFE. OUR DATA (FIGURE 1) SHOW THAT YOUNGER PEOPLE (18-31) ARE MORE EMOTIONALLY NEGATIVE, SELF-CENTERED, AND LESS CONCERNED WITH FAMILY, WHILE MIDDLE-AGED PEOPLE ARE GROUP-ORIENTED (32-44) AND FOCUSED ON FAMILY (32-64) (ALL P VALUES < .05 CORRECTED FOR MULTIPLE COMPARISONS). UNSURPRISINGLY, THE OLDEST AND MOST AT-RISK GROUP (65+) ARE MORE FOCUSED ON BIOLOGICAL TERMS (E.G., HEALTH-RELATED TOPICS), BUT WERE SURPRISINGLY LOW IN ANXIETY AND HIGH IN EMOTIONALLY POSITIVE TERMS RELATIVE TO THOSE AT LOWER RISK. WE ALSO CONTENT-ANALYZED 7,355 RESPONSES (KAPPAS > .75) TO THE QUESTION, WHAT ARE THE REASONS YOU ARE NOT SELF-ISOLATING MORE?

TABLE 1 DESCRIBES THE SEVEN PRIMARY THEMES FOR NON-COMPLIANCE. NON-ESSENTIAL WORK REQUIREMENTS, CONCERNS ABOUT MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH, AND THE BELIEF THAT OTHER PRECAUTIONS WERE SUFFICIENT WERE THE MOST COMMON REASONS, ALTHOUGH OTHER RATIONALES INCLUDED WANTING TO CONTINUE EVERYDAY ACTIVITIES AND BELIEFS THAT SOCIETY IS OVER-REACTING. CHILDCARE WAS AN IMPORTANT CONCERN FOR A SUBSET OF RESPONDENTS. OVERALL, OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT PUBLIC HEALTH MESSAGES SHOULD FOCUS ON YOUNG PEOPLE AND 1) ADDRESS THEIR NEGATIVE AFFECT, 2) REFOCUS THEIR SELF-ORIENTATION BY EMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF INDIVIDUAL BEHAVIOR TO GROUP-LEVEL HEALTH OUTCOMES, AND 3) TARGET THE SPECIFIC RATIONALES THAT DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAVE REGARDING THE PANDEMIC TO MAXIMIZE COMPLIANCE WITH SOCIAL DISTANCING.",0,1,0

THE PROGRAM WILL USE (1) A PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY TO OBTAIN TEXT MESSAGE CONTENT AND FEASIBILITY METRICS, AND (2) QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS TO EVALUATE USABILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF THE MOBILE PLATFORM. ANTICIPATED FINDINGS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS: THE MARIGOLD MOBILE PLATFORM WILL ALLOW PATIENTS TO ACCESS A TAILORED CHAT SUPPORT GROUP 24/7 AS A COMPLEMENT TO DIFFERENT FORMS OF CLINICAL OUD TREATMENT. MARIGOLD CAN KEEP GROUPS SAFE AND CONSTRUCTIVE BY AUGMENTING CHATS WITH AI TOOLS CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING THE EMOTIONAL SENTIMENT IN MESSAGES, AUTOMATICALLY ""FLAGGING"" CRITICAL OR CLINICALLY RELEVANT CONTENT. THIS PROJECT WILL DEMONSTRATE THE ROBUSTNESS OF THESE AI TOOLS BY ADAPTING THEM TO CATCH OUD-SPECIFIC ""FLAGS"" IN PEER MESSAGES WHILE ALSO EXAMINING THE ADOPTABILITY OF THE PLATFORM ITSELF WITHIN OUD PATIENTS.",0,1,0
"924","S Z, 2020, ","BACKGROUND: EATING DISORDERS (EDS) ARE A GROUP OF MENTAL ILLNESSES THAT HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON BOTH MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH. AS SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS (EG, TWITTER) HAVE BECOME AN IMPORTANT DATA SOURCE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH, SOME STUDIES HAVE QUALITATIVELY EXPLORED THE WAYS IN WHICH EDS ARE DISCUSSED ON THESE PLATFORMS. INITIAL RESULTS SUGGEST THAT SUCH RESEARCH OFFERS A PROMISING METHOD FOR FURTHER UNDERSTANDING THIS GROUP OF DISEASES. NEVERTHELESS, AN EFFICIENT COMPUTATIONAL METHOD IS NEEDED TO FURTHER IDENTIFY AND ANALYZE TWEETS RELEVANT TO EDS ON A LARGER SCALE. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMS TO DEVELOP AND VALIDATE A MACHINE LEARNING-BASED CLASSIFIER TO IDENTIFY TWEETS RELATED TO EDS AND TO EXPLORE FACTORS (IE, TOPICS) RELATED TO EDS USING A TOPIC MODELING METHOD. METHODS: WE COLLECTED POTENTIAL ED-RELEVANT TWEETS USING KEYWORDS FROM PREVIOUS STUDIES AND ANNOTATED THESE TWEETS INTO DIFFERENT GROUPS (IE, ED RELEVANT VS IRRELEVANT AND THEN PROMOTIONAL INFORMATION VS LAYPEOPLE DISCUSSION). SEVERAL SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING METHODS, SUCH AS CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN), LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (LSTM), SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE, AND NAVE BAYES, WERE DEVELOPED AND EVALUATED USING ANNOTATED DATA. WE USED THE CLASSIFIER WITH THE BEST PERFORMANCE TO IDENTIFY ED-RELEVANT TWEETS AND APPLIED A TOPIC MODELING METHOD-CORRELATION EXPLANATION (COREX)-TO ANALYZE THE CONTENT OF THE IDENTIFIED TWEETS. TO VALIDATE THESE MACHINE LEARNING RESULTS, WE ALSO COLLECTED A COHORT OF ED-RELEVANT TWEETS ON THE BASIS OF MANUALLY CURATED RULES. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 123,977 TWEETS WERE COLLECTED DURING THE SET PERIOD. WE RANDOMLY ANNOTATED 2219 TWEETS FOR DEVELOPING THE MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFIERS. WE DEVELOPED A CNN-LSTM CLASSIFIER TO IDENTIFY ED-RELEVANT TWEETS PUBLISHED BY LAYPEOPLE IN 2 STEPS: FIRST RELEVANT VERSUS IRRELEVANT (F(1) SCORE=0.89) AND THEN PROMOTIONAL VERSUS PUBLISHED BY LAYPEOPLE (F(1) SCORE=0.90). A TOTAL OF 40,790 ED-RELEVANT TWEETS WERE IDENTIFIED USING THE CNN-LSTM CLASSIFIER. WE ALSO IDENTIFIED ANOTHER SET OF TWEETS (IE, 17,632 ED-RELEVANT AND 83,557 ED-IRRELEVANT TWEETS) POSTED BY LAYPEOPLE USING MANUALLY SPECIFIED RULES. USING COREX ON ALL ED-RELEVANT TWEETS, THE TOPIC MODEL IDENTIFIED 162 TOPICS. OVERALL, THE COHERENCE RATE FOR TOPIC MODELING WAS 77.07% (1264/1640), INDICATING A HIGH QUALITY OF THE PRODUCED TOPICS. THE TOPICS WERE FURTHER REVIEWED AND ANALYZED BY A DOMAIN EXPERT. CONCLUSIONS: A DEVELOPED CNN-LSTM CLASSIFIER COULD IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF IDENTIFYING ED-RELEVANT TWEETS COMPARED WITH THE TRADITIONAL MANUAL-BASED METHOD. THE COREX TOPIC MODEL WAS APPLIED ON THE TWEETS IDENTIFIED BY THE MACHINE LEARNING-BASED CLASSIFIER AND THE TRADITIONAL MANUAL APPROACH SEPARATELY. HIGHLY OVERLAPPING TOPICS WERE OBSERVED BETWEEN THE 2 COHORTS OF TWEETS. THE PRODUCED TOPICS WERE FURTHER REVIEWED BY A DOMAIN EXPERT.

WE USED MARKET BASKET ANALYSIS (MBA) TO IDENTIFY CO-OCCURRING SOCIAL NEEDS. RESULTS THE MOST FREQUENT NEEDS LEADING TO A SOCIAL WORK REFERRAL WERE FINANCIAL (25%), PREGNANCY (25%), BEHAVIORAL HEALTH (16%), AND FAMILY/SOCIAL SUPPORT (9%) NEEDS. THE MOST FREQUENTLY CO-OCCURRING NEEDS ARE PREGNANCY WITH LANGUAGE LIMITATION (SUPPORT = 0.07; CONFIDENCE = 0.78); BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WITH FAMILY/SOCIAL SUPPORT (SUPPORT = 0.03; CONFIDENCE = 0.28); AND FINANCIAL WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH (SUPPORT = 0.025; CONFIDENCE = 0.14). CONCLUSION THE DIVERSITY OF REASONS FOR SOCIAL WORK REFERRALS SIGNIFIES THE COMPLEXITIES OF SOCIAL NEEDS AMONG PATIENTS AND THE POTENTIAL ROLE FOR SOCIAL WORKERS IN ADDRESSING THESE NEEDS.

IN THIS STUDY, WE EVALUATE SOME POPULAR DISTANCE MEASURES PERFORMANCE AND PROPOSE NEW ONES THAT EXPLOIT WORD FREQUENCIES AND THE ORDINAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEM. IN PARTICULAR, WE PROPOSE NEW DISTANCE MEASURES THAT ARE BASED ON THE VALUE DISTANCE METRIC (VDM) AND THE INVERTED SPECIFIC-CLASS DISTANCE MEASURE (ISCDM). THE PROPOSED MEASURES ARE SUITABLE FOR DOCUMENTS REPRESENTED AS VECTORS OF WORD FREQUENCIES. WE COMPARE THESE MEASURES PERFORMANCE WITH THEIR ORIGINAL COUNTERPARTS AND WITH POWERFUL NAVE BAYESIAN-BASED TEXT CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS. WE EVALUATE THE PROPOSED DISTANCE MEASURES USING THE KNN ALGORITHM ON 18 BENCHMARK TEXT CLASSIFICATION DATASETS. OUR EMPIRICAL RESULTS REVEAL THAT THE DISTANCE METRICS FOR NOMINAL VALUES RENDER BETTER CLASSIFICATION RESULTS FOR TEXT CLASSIFICATION THAN THE EUCLIDEAN DISTANCE MEASURE FOR NUMERIC VALUES. FURTHERMORE, OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT ISCDM SUBSTANTIALLY OUTPERFORMS VDM, BUT IT IS ALSO MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO MAKE USE OF THE ORDINAL NATURE OF TERM-FREQUENCIES THAN VDM. THUS, WE WERE ABLE TO PROPOSE MORE ISCDM-BASED DISTANCE MEASURES FOR TEXT CLASSIFICATION THAN VDM-BASED MEASURES.

"946","KHAN NS, 2020, ","BACKGROUND/INTRODUCTION: THE DEAF COMMUNITY IN THE WORLD USES A GESTURE-BASED LANGUAGE, GENERALLY KNOWN AS SIGN LANGUAGE. EVERY COUNTRY HAS A DIFFERENT SIGN LANGUAGE; FOR INSTANCE, USA HAS AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE (ASL) AND UK HAS BRITISH SIGN LANGUAGE (BSL). THE DEAF COMMUNITY IN PAKISTAN USES PAKISTAN SIGN LANGUAGE (PSL), WHICH LIKE OTHER NATURAL LANGUAGES, HAS A VOCABULARY, SENTENCE STRUCTURE, AND WORD ORDER. MAJORITY OF THE HEARING COMMUNITY IS NOT AWARE OF PSL DUE TO WHICH THERE EXISTS A HUGE COMMUNICATION GAP BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. SIMILARLY, DEAF PERSONS ARE UNABLE TO READ TEXT WRITTEN IN ENGLISH AND URDU. HENCE, THE PROVISION OF AN EFFECTIVE TRANSLATION MODEL CAN SUPPORT THE COGNITIVE CAPABILITY OF THE DEAF COMMUNITY TO INTERPRET NATURAL LANGUAGE MATERIALS AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET AND IN OTHER USEFUL RESOURCES. METHODS: THIS RESEARCH INVOLVES EXPLOITING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) TECHNIQUES TO SUPPORT THE DEAF COMMUNITY BY PROPOSING A NOVEL MACHINE TRANSLATION MODEL THAT TRANSLATES ENGLISH SENTENCES INTO EQUIVALENT PAKISTAN SIGN LANGUAGE (PSL). THOUGH A LARGE NUMBER OF MACHINE TRANSLATION SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED FOR NATURAL TO NATURAL LANGUAGE TRANSLATIONS, NATURAL TO SIGN LANGUAGE MACHINE TRANSLATION IS A RELATIVELY NEW AREA OF RESEARCH. STATE-OF-THE-ART WORKS IN NATURAL TO SIGN LANGUAGE TRANSLATION ARE MOSTLY DOMAIN SPECIFIC AND SUFFER FROM LOW ACCURACY SCORES. MAJOR REASONS ARE SPECIALISED LANGUAGE STRUCTURES FOR SIGN LANGUAGES, AND LACK OF ANNOTATED CORPORA TO FACILITATE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE GENERALISABLE MACHINE TRANSLATION SYSTEMS. TO THIS END, A GRAMMAR-BASED MACHINE TRANSLATION MODEL IS PROPOSED TO TRANSLATE SENTENCES WRITTEN IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE INTO EQUIVALENT PSL SENTENCES. TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, THIS IS A FIRST EFFORT TO TRANSLATE ANY NATURAL LANGUAGE TO PSL USING CORE NLP TECHNIQUES. THE PROPOSED APPROACH INVOLVES A STRUCTURED PROCESS TO INVESTIGATE THE LINGUISTIC STRUCTURE OF PSL AND FORMULATE THE GRAMMATICAL STRUCTURE OF PSL SENTENCES. THESE RULES ARE THEN FORMALISED INTO A CONTEXT-FREE GRAMMAR, WHICH, IN TURN, CAN BE EFFICIENTLY IMPLEMENTED AS A PARSING MODULE FOR TRANSLATION AND VALIDATION OF TARGET PSL SENTENCES. THE WHOLE CONCEPT IS IMPLEMENTED AS A SOFTWARE SYSTEM, COMPRISING THE NLP PIPELINE AND AN EXTERNAL SERVICE TO RENDER THE AVATAR-BASED VIDEO OF TRANSLATED WORDS, IN ORDER TO COMPENSATE THE COGNITIVE HEARING DEFICIT OF DEAF PEOPLE. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: THE ACCURACY OF THE PROPOSED TRANSLATION MODEL HAS BEEN EVALUATED MANUALLY AND AUTOMATICALLY. QUANTITATIVE RESULTS REVEAL A VERY PROMISING BILINGUAL EVALUATION UNDERSTUDY (BLEU) SCORE OF 0.78. SUBJECTIVE EVALUATIONS DEMONSTRATE THAT THE SYSTEM CAN COMPENSATE FOR THE COGNITIVE HEARING DEFICIT OF END USERS THROUGH THE SYSTEM OUTPUT EXPRESSED AS A READILY INTERPRETABLE AVATAR.

WHILST CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF AUTISM MAY MAKE INDIVIDUALS VULNERABLE TO INCREASED INVOLVEMENT WITH THE POLICE, EITHER AS A VICTIM OR PERSON OF INTEREST, EVIDENCE REGARDING THIS IS SCANT. THE PRESENT STUDY USED A POPULATION-BASED DATASET TO DESCRIBE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE EVENTS INVOLVING AUTISTIC AND NON-AUTISTIC ADULTS. METHODS: TEXT MINING AND DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS WERE APPLIED TO POLICE-RECORDED DATA FOR 1,601 DOMESTIC VIOLENCE EVENTS INVOLVING AUTISM AND 414,840 EVENTS NOT INVOLVING AUTISM IN THE STATE OF NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA FROM JANUARY 2005 TO DECEMBER 2016. RESULTS: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AUTISTIC VICTIMS AND PERPETRATORS WAS PREDOMINANTLY FAMILIAL OR CARER WHEREAS EVENTS NOT INVOLVING AUTISM WERE PREDOMINANTLY INVOLVED INTIMATE PARTNERS. ABUSE TYPES AND INJURIES SUSTAINED WERE SIMILAR FOR BOTH AUTISTIC AND NON-AUTISTIC EVENTS. THE MOST COMMON MENTAL CONDITIONS PRESENT IN AUTISTIC PERPETRATORS WERE DEVELOPMENTAL CONDITIONS AND INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY, WHILST NON-AUTISTIC PERPETRATORS MOST COMMONLY REPORTED PSYCHOACTIVE SUBSTANCE USE OR SCHIZOPHRENIA.

"968","WANG D, 2020, ","BACKGROUND: ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES (E-CIGARETTES) HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY POPULAR. CHINA HAS ACCELERATED ITS LEGISLATION ON E-CIGARETTES IN RECENT YEARS BY ISSUING TWO POLICIES TO REGULATE THEIR USE: THE FIRST ON AUGUST 26, 2018, AND THE SECOND ON NOVEMBER 1, 2019. SOCIAL MEDIA PROVIDE AN EFFICIENT PLATFORM TO ACCESS INFORMATION ON THE PUBLIC OPINION OF E-CIGARETTES. OBJECTIVE: TO GAIN INSIGHT INTO HOW POLICIES HAVE INFLUENCED THE REACTION OF THE CHINESE PUBLIC TO E-CIGARETTES, THIS STUDY AIMS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CHINESE PUBLIC SAY ABOUT E-CIGARETTES AND HOW THE FOCUS OF DISCUSSION MIGHT HAVE CHANGED IN THE CONTEXT OF POLICY IMPLEMENTATION. METHODS: THIS STUDY USES A COMBINATION OF TEXT MINING AND CORRESPONDENCE ANALYSIS TO CONTENT ANALYZE 1160 E-CIGARETTE-RELATED QUESTIONS AND THEIR CORRESPONDING ANSWERS FROM ZHIHU, CHINA'S LARGEST QUESTION-AND-ANSWER PLATFORM AND ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S MOST TRUSTWORTHY SOCIAL MEDIA SOURCES. FROM JANUARY 1, 2017, TO DECEMBER 31, 2019, PYTHON WAS USED TO TEXT MINE THE MOST FREQUENTLY USED WORDS AND PHRASES IN PUBLIC E-CIGARETTE DISCUSSIONS ON ZHIHU. THE CORRESPONDENCE ANALYSIS WAS USED TO EXAMINE THE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HIGH-FREQUENCY WORDS AND PHRASES ACROSS 3 PERIODS (IE, JANUARY 1, 2017, TO AUGUST 27, 2018; AUGUST 28, 2018, TO OCTOBER 31, 2019; AND NOVEMBER 1, 2019, TO JANUARY 1, 2020). RESULTS: THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY SHOWED THAT THE CONSISTENT THEMES ACROSS TIME WERE COMPARISONS WITH TRADITIONAL CIGARETTES, HEALTH CONCERNS, AND HOW TO CHOOSE E-CIGARETTE PRODUCTS. THE ISSUANCE OF GOVERNMENT POLICIES ON E-CIGARETTES LED TO A CHANGE IN THE FOCUS OF PUBLIC DISCUSSION. THE DISCUSSION OF E-CIGARETTES IN PERIOD 1 MAINLY FOCUSED ON THE USE AND EXPERIENCE OF E-CIGARETTES. IN PERIOD 2, THE PUBLIC'S ATTENTION WAS NOT ONLY ON THE SUBSTANCES RELATED TO E-CIGARETTES BUT ALSO ON THE SMOKING CESSATION FUNCTIONS OF E-CIGARETTES. IN PERIOD 3, THE PUBLIC SHIFTED THEIR ATTENTION TO THE E-CIGARETTE INDUSTRY AND GOVERNMENT POLICY ON THE BANNING OF E-CIGARETTE SALES TO MINORS. CONCLUSIONS: SOCIAL MEDIA ARE AN INFORMATIVE SOURCE, WHICH CAN HELP POLICY MAKERS AND PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS UNDERSTAND THE PUBLIC'S CONCERNS OVER AND UNDERSTANDING OF E-CIGARETTES. WHEN THERE WAS LITTLE REGULATION, PUBLIC DISCUSSION WAS GREATLY INFLUENCED BY INDUSTRY CLAIMS ABOUT E-CIGARETTES; HOWEVER, ONCE E-CIGARETTE POLICIES WERE ISSUED, THESE POLICIES, TO A LARGE EXTENT, SET THE AGENDA FOR PUBLIC DISCUSSION. IN ADDITION, MEDIA REPORTING OF THESE POLICIES MIGHT HAVE GREATLY INFLUENCED THE WAY E-CIGARETTE POLICIES WERE DISCUSSED. THEREFORE, MONITORING E-CIGARETTE DISCUSSIONS ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND RESPONDING TO THEM IN A TIMELY MANNER WILL BOTH HELP IMPROVE THE PUBLIC'S E-CIGARETTE LITERACY AND FACILITATE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF E-CIGARETTE-RELATED POLICIES.",1,0,0

DEEP NEURAL AND RECURRENT NETWORKS OUTPERFORM TRADITIONAL MACHINE-LEARNING TECHNIQUES IN AREAS OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING AND COMPUTER VISION; HOWEVER, THEY ARE YET TO BE EXPLORED IN THE ATS DOMAIN, PARTICULARLY FOR MEDICAL TEXT SUMMARIZATION. OBJECTIVE: TRADITIONAL APPROACHES IN ATS FOR BIOMEDICAL TEXT SUFFER FROM FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES SUCH AS AN INABILITY TO CAPTURE CLINICAL CONTEXT, QUALITY OF EVIDENCE, AND PURPOSE-DRIVEN SELECTION OF PASSAGES FOR THE SUMMARY. WE AIMED TO CIRCUMVENT THESE LIMITATIONS THROUGH ACHIEVING PRECISE, SUCCINCT, AND COHERENT INFORMATION EXTRACTION FROM CREDIBLE PUBLISHED BIOMEDICAL RESOURCES, AND TO CONSTRUCT A SIMPLIFIED SUMMARY CONTAINING THE MOST INFORMATIVE CONTENT THAT CAN OFFER A REVIEW PARTICULAR TO CLINICAL NEEDS. METHODS: IN OUR PROPOSED APPROACH, WE INTRODUCE A NOVEL FRAMEWORK, TERMED BIOMED-SUMMARIZER, THAT PROVIDES QUALITY-AWARE PATIENT/PROBLEM, INTERVENTION, COMPARISON, AND OUTCOME (PICO)-BASED INTELLIGENT AND CONTEXT-ENABLED SUMMARIZATION OF BIOMEDICAL TEXT. BIOMED-SUMMARIZER INTEGRATES THE PROGNOSIS QUALITY RECOGNITION MODEL WITH A CLINICAL CONTEXT-AWARE MODEL TO LOCATE TEXT SEQUENCES IN THE BODY OF A BIOMEDICAL ARTICLE FOR USE IN THE FINAL SUMMARY. FIRST, WE DEVELOPED A DEEP NEURAL NETWORK BINARY CLASSIFIER FOR QUALITY RECOGNITION TO ACQUIRE SCIENTIFICALLY SOUND STUDIES AND FILTER OUT OTHERS. SECOND, WE DEVELOPED A BIDIRECTIONAL LONG-SHORT TERM MEMORY RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK AS A CLINICAL CONTEXT-AWARE CLASSIFIER, WHICH WAS TRAINED ON SEMANTICALLY ENRICHED FEATURES GENERATED USING A WORD-EMBEDDING TOKENIZER FOR IDENTIFICATION OF MEANINGFUL SENTENCES REPRESENTING PICO TEXT SEQUENCES. THIRD, WE CALCULATED THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN QUERY AND PICO TEXT SEQUENCES USING JACCARD SIMILARITY WITH SEMANTIC ENRICHMENTS, WHERE THE SEMANTIC ENRICHMENTS ARE OBTAINED USING MEDICAL ONTOLOGIES. LAST, WE GENERATED A REPRESENTATIVE SUMMARY FROM THE HIGH-SCORING PICO SEQUENCES AGGREGATED BY STUDY TYPE, PUBLICATION CREDIBILITY, AND FRESHNESS SCORE. RESULTS: EVALUATION OF THE PROGNOSIS QUALITY RECOGNITION MODEL USING A LARGE DATASET OF BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE RELATED TO INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSM SHOWED AN ACCURACY OF 95.41% (2562/2686) IN TERMS OF RECOGNIZING QUALITY ARTICLES. THE CLINICAL CONTEXT-AWARE MULTICLASS CLASSIFIER OUTPERFORMED THE TRADITIONAL MACHINE-LEARNING ALGORITHMS, INCLUDING SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE, GRADIENT BOOSTED TREE, LINEAR REGRESSION, K-NEAREST NEIGHBOR, AND NAIVE BAYES, BY ACHIEVING 93% (16127/17341) ACCURACY FOR CLASSIFYING FIVE CATEGORIES: AIM, POPULATION, INTERVENTION, RESULTS, AND OUTCOME. THE SEMANTIC SIMILARITY ALGORITHM ACHIEVED A SIGNIFICANT PEARSON CORRELATION COEFFICIENT OF 0.61 (0-1 SCALE) ON A WELL-KNOWN BIOSSES DATASET (WITH 100 PAIR SENTENCES) AFTER SEMANTIC ENRICHMENT, REPRESENTING AN IMPROVEMENT OF 8.9% OVER BASELINE JACCARD SIMILARITY. FINALLY, WE FOUND A HIGHLY POSITIVE CORRELATION AMONG THE EVALUATIONS PERFORMED BY THREE DOMAIN EXPERTS CONCERNING DIFFERENT METRICS, SUGGESTING THAT THE AUTOMATED SUMMARIZATION IS SATISFACTORY.

OBJECTIVE: THE GOALS OF THIS STUDY WERE TO PROVIDE A DESCRIPTIVE OVERVIEW OF ASTHMA MOBILE APPS THAT ARE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AND TO ASSESS THE USABILITY OF ASTHMA APPS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET TO IDENTIFY CONTENT AND FEATURES OF APPS ASSOCIATED WITH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE USER RATINGS. METHODS: REVIEWS WERE COLLECTED ON JUNE 23, 2020, AND INCLUDED PUBLICLY POSTED REVIEWS UNTIL JUNE 21, 2020. TO CHARACTERIZE FEATURES ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH OR LOW APP RATINGS, WE FIRST DICHOTOMIZED THE AVERAGE USER RATING OF THE ASTHMA APP INTO 2 CATEGORIES: A HIGH AVERAGE RATING AND A LOW AVERAGE RATING. ASTHMA APPS WITH AVERAGE RATINGS OF 4 AND ABOVE WERE CATEGORIZED AS HAVING A HIGH AVERAGE RATING. ASTHMA APPS WITH AVERAGE RATINGS OF LESS THAN 4 WERE CATEGORIZED AS HAVING A LOW AVERAGE RATING. FOR THE SENTIMENT ANALYSIS, WE MODELED BOTH 2-WORD (BI-GRAM) AND 3-WORD (TRI-GRAM) PHRASES WHICH COMMONLY APPEARED ACROSS HIGHLY RATED AND LOWLY RATED APPS. RESULTS: OF THE 10 APPS THAT MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA, A TOTAL OF 373 REVIEWS WERE EXAMINED ACROSS ALL APPS. AMONG APPS REVIEWED, 53.4% (199/373) RECEIVED HIGH RATINGS (AVERAGE RATINGS OF 4 OR 5) AND 47.2% (176/373) RECEIVED LOW RATINGS (AVERAGE RATINGS OF 3 OR LESS). THE NUMBER OF RATINGS ACROSS ALL APPS RANGED FROM 188 (ASTHMAMD) TO 10 (MY ASTHMA APP); 30% (3/10) OF APPS WERE AVAILABLE ON BOTH ANDROID AND IOS. FROM THE SENTIMENT ANALYSIS, KEY FEATURES OF ASTHMA MANAGEMENT THAT WERE COMMON AMONG HIGHLY RATED APPS INCLUDED THE TRACKING OF PEAK FLOW READINGS (N=48), ASTHMA SYMPTOM MONITORING (N=11), AND ACTION PLANS (N=10). KEY FEATURES RELATED TO FUNCTIONALITY THAT WERE COMMON AMONG HIGHLY RATED APPS INCLUDED EASE OF USE (N=5). USERS MOST COMMONLY REPORTED LOSS OF DATA (N=14) AND CRASHING OF APP (N=12) AS FUNCTIONALITY ISSUES AMONG POORLY RATED ASTHMA APPS. CONCLUSIONS: OUR STUDY RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT ASTHMA APP QUALITY, MAINTENANCE, AND UPDATES VARY WIDELY ACROSS APPS AND PLATFORMS. THESE FINDINGS MAY CALL INTO QUESTION THE LONG-TERM ENGAGEMENT WITH ASTHMA APPS, A CRUCIAL FACTOR FOR DETERMINING THEIR POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE ASTHMA SELF-MANAGEMENT AND ASTHMA CLINICAL OUTCOMES.",1,1,0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: WE SEARCHED PUBMED, OVID, AND WEB OF SCIENCE FOR ARTICLES PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH BETWEEN 2013 AND 2019. WE PERFORMED A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW TO ANSWER 5 KEY QUESTIONS: (1) WHAT WERE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF PARTICIPANT GROUPS? (2) WHAT LANGUAGE DATA WERE COLLECTED? (3) WHAT FEATURES OF SPEECH AND LANGUAGE WERE THE MOST INFORMATIVE? (4) WHAT METHODS WERE USED TO CLASSIFY BETWEEN GROUPS? (5) WHAT CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE WAS ACHIEVED? RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: WE IDENTIFIED 33 ELIGIBLE STUDIES AND 5 MAIN FINDINGS: PARTICIPANTS' DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES (ESPECIALLY AGE ) WERE OFTEN UNBALANCED BETWEEN AD AND CONTROL GROUP; SPONTANEOUS SPEECH DATA WERE COLLECTED MOST OFTEN; INFORMATIVE LANGUAGE FEATURES WERE RELATED TO WORD RETRIEVAL AND SEMANTIC, SYNTACTIC, AND ACOUSTIC IMPAIRMENT; NEURAL NETS, SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES, AND DECISION TREES PERFORMED WELL IN AD DETECTION, AND SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES AND DECISION TREES PERFORMED WELL IN DECLINE DETECTION; AND AVERAGE CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY WAS 89% IN AD AND 82% IN MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT DETECTION VERSUS HEALTHY CONTROL GROUPS. CONCLUSION: THE SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW SUPPORTED THE ARGUMENT THAT LANGUAGE AND SPEECH COULD SUCCESSFULLY BE USED TO DETECT DEMENTIA AUTOMATICALLY.

OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMS TO IDENTIFY SOCIAL STIGMA AND NEGATIVE SENTIMENT TOWARD THE BLAMEWORTHY AGENTS IN SOCIAL COMMUNITIES. METHODS: WE ENABLED A TAILORED TEXT-MINING PLATFORM TO IDENTIFY DATA IN THEIR NATURAL SETTINGS BY RETRIEVING AND FILTERING ONLINE SOURCES, AND CONSTRUCTED VOCABULARIES AND LEARNING WORD REPRESENTATIONS FROM NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING FOR DEDUCTIVE ANALYSIS ALONG WITH THE RESEARCH THEME. THE DATA SOURCES COMPRISED OF TEN NEWS WEBSITES, ELEVEN DISCUSSION FORUMS, ONE SOCIAL NETWORK, AND TWO PRINCIPAL MEDIA SHARING NETWORKS IN TAIWAN.

OUR DATA SHOWED THAT ONLINE NEWS SERVED AS A HOTBED FOR NEGATIVITY AND FOR DRIVING EMOTIONAL SOCIAL POSTS. ONLINE INFORMATION REGARDING COVID-19 ASSOCIATED IT WITH CHINA-AND A SPECIFIC CITY WITHIN CHINA THROUGH REFERENCES TO THE WUHAN PNEUMONIA-POTENTIALLY ENCOURAGING XENOPHOBIA. THE ADOPTION OF THIS PROBLEMATIC MONIKER HAD A HIGH FREQUENCY, DESPITE THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION GUIDELINE TO AVOID BIASED PERCEPTIONS AND ETHNIC DISCRIMINATION. SOCIAL STIGMA IS DISCLOSED THROUGH NEGATIVELY VALENCED RESPONSES, WHICH ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE MOST BLAMED TARGETS. CONCLUSIONS: OUR SAMPLE IS SUFFICIENTLY REPRESENTATIVE OF A COMMUNITY BECAUSE IT CONTAINS A BROAD RANGE OF MAINSTREAM ONLINE MEDIA. STIGMATIZING LANGUAGE LINKED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC SHOWS A LACK OF CIVIC RESPONSIBILITY THAT ENCOURAGES BIAS, HOSTILITY, AND DISCRIMINATION. FREQUENTLY USED STIGMATIZING TERMS WERE DEEMED OFFENSIVE, AND THEY MIGHT HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO RECENT BACKLASHES AGAINST CHINA BY DIRECTING BLAME AND ENCOURAGING XENOPHOBIA.

WE WISHED TO IDENTIFY TWITTER USER GENDER PROFILE; MOST COMMON DISCUSSION TOPICS; SENTIMENT ANALYSIS; AND DISSEMINATION OF TWEETS. METHODS A THIRD-PARTY DATA ANALYTICS COMPANY CONDUCTED A TWITTER SOCIAL MEDIA ANALYSIS OVER A RANDOMLY CHOSEN 14-DAY PERIOD BETWEEN THE DATES 22 JUNE AND 5 JULY 2017. ALL RELEVANT KEYWORDS WERE INCLUDED IN THE SEARCH. AUTHOR GROUP CONSENSUS YIELDED 24 TERMS. GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION WAS RESTRICTED TO IRELAND. A COMPUTATIONAL SENTIMENT DICTIONARY WAS USED TO PROVIDE A RATING OF THE EMOTIONAL PROPERTIES OF THE TEXT ON A 9-POINT SCALE FROM -5 TO +4 OF NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE SENTIMENT. DISSEMINATION WAS CALCULATED BY THE NUMBER OF TIMES THE TWEET WAS DISPLAYED ('IMPRESSIONS'). RESULTS THERE WERE 941 TWEETS IDENTIFIED DURING THE STUDY FROM 715 CONTRIBUTORS. THESE GENERATED 2.88 MILLION IMPRESSIONS. THE MOST FREQUENTLY OCCURRING KEYWORDS WERE HEADACHE (N=321); MIGRAINE (N=147); BACK PAIN (N=123); CANNABIS (N=114); AND CHRONIC PAIN (N=85). THERE WERE 1.94 TIMES AS MANY TWEETS FROM FEMALES AS MALES. THE HIGHEST PROPORTION OF TWEETS FROM FEMALE USERS WAS IN THE FIBROMYALGIA (83%) AND MIGRAINE (60%) CATEGORIES; AND FROM MALES IN THE SCIATICA (35%), CHRONIC PAIN (34%) AND BACK PAIN (32%) CATEGORIES. CANNABIS-RELATED TWEETS REFLECTED MOSTLY NON-PERSONAL CONTENT (90%), WITH A HIGHLY POSITIVE SENTIMENT, AND THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF IMPRESSIONS PER TWEET.

WITH COMPLIANCE AT APPROXIMATELY 40% FOR HOME-BASED EXERCISE PRESCRIPTIONS, IMPLEMENTING A REMOTE SENSING SYSTEM WOULD HELP PATIENTS AND CLINICIANS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND TREATMENT PROGRESS AND INCREASE COMPLIANCE. THE INCLUSION OF END USERS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MOBILE APPS FOR REMOTE-SENSING SYSTEMS CAN ENSURE THAT THEY ARE BOTH USER FRIENDLY AND FACILITATE COMPLIANCE. WITH ADVANCEMENTS IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP), THERE IS POTENTIAL FOR THESE METHODS TO BE USED WITH DATA COLLECTED THROUGH THE USER-CENTERED DESIGN PROCESS. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMS TO DEVELOP A MOBILE APP FOR A NOVEL DEVICE THROUGH A USER-CENTERED DESIGN PROCESS WITH BOTH OLDER ADULTS AND CLINICIANS WHILE EXPLORING WHETHER DATA COLLECTED THROUGH THIS PROCESS CAN BE USED IN NLP AND SENTIMENT ANALYSIS METHODS: THROUGH A USER-CENTERED DESIGN PROCESS, WE CONDUCTED SEMISTRUCTURED INTERVIEWS DURING THE DEVELOPMENT OF A GERIATRIC-FRIENDLY BLUETOOTH-CONNECTED RESISTANCE EXERCISE BAND APP. WE INTERVIEWED PATIENTS AND CLINICIANS AT WEEKS 0, 5, AND 10 OF THE APP DEVELOPMENT. EACH SEMISTRUCTURED INTERVIEW CONSISTED OF HEURISTIC EVALUATIONS, COGNITIVE WALKTHROUGHS, AND OBSERVATIONS. WE USED THE BING SENTIMENT LIBRARY FOR A SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPTS AND THEN APPLIED NLP-BASED LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION (LDA) TOPIC MODELING TO IDENTIFY DIFFERENCES AND SIMILARITIES IN PATIENT AND CLINICIAN PARTICIPANT INTERVIEWS. SENTIMENT WAS DEFINED AS THE SUM OF POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE WORDS (EACH WORD WITH A +1 OR -1 VALUE). TO ASSESS UTILITY, WE USED QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT QUESTIONNAIRES-SYSTEM USABILITY SCALE (SUS) AND USEFULNESS, SATISFACTION, AND EASE OF USE (USE). FINALLY, WE USED MULTIVARIATE LINEAR MODELS-ADJUSTING FOR AGE, SEX, SUBJECT GROUP (CLINICIAN VS PATIENT), AND DEVELOPMENT-TO EXPLORE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SENTIMENT ANALYSIS AND SUS AND USE OUTCOMES. RESULTS: THE MEAN AGE OF THE 22 PARTICIPANTS WAS 68 (SD 14) YEARS, AND 17 (77%) WERE FEMALE. THE OVERALL MEAN SUS AND USE SCORES WERE 66.4 (SD 13.6) AND 41.3 (SD 15.2), RESPECTIVELY. BOTH PATIENTS AND CLINICIANS PROVIDED VALUABLE INSIGHTS INTO THE NEEDS OF OLDER ADULTS WHEN DESIGNING AND BUILDING AN APP. THE MEAN POSITIVE-NEGATIVE SENTIMENT PER SENTENCE WAS 0.19 (SD 0.21) AND 0.47 (SD 0.21) FOR PATIENT AND CLINICIAN INTERVIEWS, RESPECTIVELY. WE FOUND A POSITIVE ASSOCIATION WITH POSITIVE SENTIMENT IN AN INTERVIEW AND SUS SCORE (BETA=1.38; 95% CI 0.37 TO 2.39; P=.01). THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SENTIMENT AND THE USE SCORE. THE LDA ANALYSIS FOUND NO OVERLAP BETWEEN PATIENTS AND CLINICIANS IN THE 8 IDENTIFIED TOPICS. CONCLUSIONS: INVOLVING PATIENTS AND CLINICIANS ALLOWED US TO DESIGN AND BUILD AN APP THAT IS USER FRIENDLY FOR OLDER ADULTS WHILE SUPPORTING COMPLIANCE.

THE METHOD APPLIES TO A WIDE RANGE OF INFLECTIONAL LANGUAGES AS IT IDENTIFIES MORPHOLOGICAL VARIANTS FORMED THROUGH DIFFERENT LINGUISTIC PROCESSES SUCH AS AFFIXATION, COMPOUNDING, CONVERSION, ETC. THE PROPOSED APPROACH HAS BEEN TESTED IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL APPLICATION FOR FOUR LANGUAGES (ENGLISH, MARATHI, HUNGARIAN, AND BENGALI) USING STANDARD TREC, CLEF, AND FIRE TEST COLLECTIONS. A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OVER WORD-BASED RETRIEVAL, FIVE OTHER CORPUS-BASED STEMMERS, AND RULE-BASED STEMMERS HAS BEEN ACHIEVED IN ALL THE LANGUAGES.

NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) OFFERS NEW APPROACHES FOR IDENTIFYING HIDDEN PATTERNS WITHIN THE LEXICON OF STORIES THAT MAY REVEAL INSIGHTS ABOUT THE TAXONOMY OF SERIOUS ILLNESS CONVERSATIONS. METHODS: WE ANALYZED VERBATIM TRANSCRIPTS FROM 354 CONSULTATIONS INVOLVING 231 PATIENTS AND 45 PALLIATIVE CARE CLINICIANS FROM THE PALLIATIVE CARE COMMUNICATION RESEARCH INITIATIVE. WE STRATIFIED EACH CONVERSATION INTO DECILES OF 'NARRATIVE TIME' BASED ON WORD COUNTS. WE USED STANDARD NLP ANALYSES TO EXAMINE THE FREQUENCY AND DISTRIBUTION OF WORDS AND PHRASES INDICATING TEMPORAL REFERENCE, ILLNESS TERMINOLOGY, SENTIMENT AND MODAL VERBS (INDICATING POSSIBILITY/DESIRABILITY). RESULTS: TEMPORAL REFERENCES SHIFTED STEADILY FROM TALKING ABOUT THE PAST TO TALKING ABOUT THE FUTURE OVER DECILES OF NARRATIVE TIME.

FOR LEARNING-BASED METHODS, A LOT OF ENHANCED TECHNICAL STRATEGIES HAVE BEEN USED TO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE METHODS. FEATURE SELECTION IS ONE OF THESE STRATEGIES AND IT HAS BEEN STUDIED BY MANY RESEARCHERS. HOWEVER, AN EXISTING UNSOLVED DIFFICULT PROBLEM IS THE CHOICE OF A SUITABLE NUMBER OF FEATURES FOR OBTAINING THE BEST SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE OF THE LEARNING-BASED METHODS. THEREFORE, WE INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF FEATURES SELECTED AND THE SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE OF THE LEARNING-BASED METHODS. A NEW METHOD FOR THE SELECTION OF A SUITABLE NUMBER OF FEATURES IS PROPOSED IN WHICH THE CHI SQUARE FEATURE SELECTION ALGORITHM IS EMPLOYED AND THE FEATURES ARE SELECTED USING A PRESET SCORE THRESHOLD. IT IS DISCOVERED THAT THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE LOGARITHM OF THE NUMBER OF FEATURES SELECTED AND THE SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE OF THE LEARNING-BASED METHOD, AND IT IS ALSO FOUND THAT THIS RELATIONSHIP IS INDEPENDENT OF THE LEARNING-BASED METHOD INVOLVED. THE NEW FINDINGS IN THIS RESEARCH INDICATE THAT IT IS ALWAYS POSSIBLE FOR RESEARCHERS TO SELECT THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF FEATURES FOR LEARNING-BASED METHODS TO OBTAIN THE BEST SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE.

SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF USER-GENERATED CONTENT IS ONE OF THE MAIN COGNITIVE COMPUTING BRANCHES; HENCE, IT HAS ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF MANY SCHOLARS IN RECENT YEARS. ONE OF THE MAIN TASKS OF THE SENTIMENT ANALYSIS IS TO DETECT POLARITY WITHIN A TEXT. THE EXISTING POLARITY DETECTION METHODS MAINLY FOCUS ON KEYWORDS AND THEIR NAVE FREQUENCY COUNTS; HOWEVER, THEY LESS REGARD THE MEANINGS AND IMPLICIT DIMENSIONS OF THE NATURAL CONCEPTS. ALTHOUGH BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN DETERMINING THE POLARITY OF CONCEPTS, IT HAS BEEN DISREGARDED IN POLARITY DETECTION METHODS. THIS STUDY PRESENTS A CONTEXT-BASED MODEL TO SOLVE AMBIGUOUS POLARITY CONCEPTS USING COMMONSENSE KNOWLEDGE. FIRST, A MODEL IS PRESENTED TO GENERATE A SOURCE OF AMBIGUOUS SENTIMENT CONCEPTS BASED ON SENTICNET BY COMPUTING THE PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION. THEN, THE MODEL USES A BAG-OF-CONCEPTS APPROACH TO REMOVE AMBIGUITIES AND SEMANTIC AUGMENTATION WITH THE CONCEPTNET HANDLING TO OVERCOME LOST KNOWLEDGE. CONCEPTNET IS A LARGE-SCALE SEMANTIC NETWORK WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF COMMONSENSE CONCEPTS. IN THIS PAPER, THE POINT MUTUAL INFORMATION (PMI) MEASURE IS USED TO SELECT THE CONTEXTUAL CONCEPTS HAVING STRONG RELATIONSHIPS WITH AMBIGUOUS CONCEPTS. THE POLARITY OF THE AMBIGUOUS CONCEPTS IS PRECISELY DETECTED USING POSITIVE/NEGATIVE CONTEXTUAL CONCEPTS AND THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE CONCEPTS IN THE SEMANTIC KNOWLEDGE BASE. THE TEXT REPRESENTATION SCHEME IS SEMANTICALLY ENRICHED USING NUMBERBATCH, WHICH IS A WORD EMBEDDING MODEL BASED ON THE CONCEPTS FROM THE CONCEPTNET SEMANTIC NETWORK. IN THIS REGARD, THE COSINE SIMILARITY METRIC IS USED TO MEASURE SIMILARITY AND SELECT A CONCEPT FROM THE CONCEPTNET NETWORK FOR SEMANTIC AUGMENTATION. PRE-TRAINED CONCEPTS VECTORS FACILITATE THE MORE EFFECTIVE COMPUTATION OF SEMANTIC SIMILARITY AMONG THE CONCERNED CONCEPTS.

THE PERFORMANCES OF DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF SIX ALGORITHMS AND TWO TERM WEIGHTING FACTORS WERE COMPARED UNDER VARIOUS TRAINING SET SIZES, WHICH WERE ASSESSED BY PRECISION, RECALL, F1-VALUE AND ACCURACY. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 3600 PSYCHIATRIC INPATIENTS (1800 WITH SUICIDAL BEHAVIORS AND 1800 WITHOUT SUICIDAL BEHAVIORS) WERE INCLUDED IN THIS STUDY. IN CHIEF COMPLAINTS OF SUICIDAL INPATIENTS, 'SUICIDE', 'NOTION' AND 'SUSPICION' WERE THE COMMONEST STATEMENTS, APPEARING 1228, 705 AND 638 TIMES RESPECTIVELY. IN CONTRAST, 'EXCITEMENT', 'INSTABILITY' AND 'IMPULSION' APPEARED MORE FREQUENTLY IN CHIEF COMPLAINTS OF PATIENTS WITHOUT SUICIDAL BEHAVIORS (599, 599, 534 TIMES RESPECTIVELY). THE PERFORMANCE OF EACH ALGORITHM WAS GENERALLY IMPROVED WITH THE INCREASING TRAINING SET SIZES AND TENDED TO BE STABLE WHEN THE NUMBER OF TRAINING CASES REACHED 1000, WHERE MOST OF THEM COULD ACHIEVE SATISFACTORY ACCURACY VALUES (>0.95).

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO UTILISE A MULTI-METHOD APPROACH TO EXAMINE THE BARRIERS THAT AFFECT LEARNERS INTENTION TO USE E-LEARNING SERVICES. THE MULTI-METHOD APPROACH CONSISTS OF QUALITATIVE SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS OF 8 PARTICIPANTS, TOPIC-MODELLING ON 3227 REVIEWS FROM COURSERA DATASET AND 463 RESPONSES FROM AN ONLINE SURVEY FOR QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS. THE INTERVIEWS REVEALED THEMES LIKE RIGID-COURSE-STRUCTURE, COMPLEXITY, QUALITY-OF-FACILITATOR, AND VALUE-ADDITION. THE TOPIC-MODELLING APPROACH EXTRACTED THEMES LIKE, TECHNIQUE-OF-TEACHING, LANGUAGE-OF-SPEAKER, COURSE-CONTENT, PRIVACY, PAYMENT-ISSUES, ETC. THE EMPIRICAL STUDY REVEALED THAT VALUE [COURSE-CONTENT (COURSE-CONTENT, VALUE-ADDITION) AND FACILITATOR-ISSUES (QUALITY-OF-FACILITATOR, HANDLING-OF-QUERIES)], TRADITION [TRUST (PRIVACY CONCERNS, AUTHENTICITY, RELIABILITY)] AND RISK [PAYMENT ISSUES (PAYMENT-FAILURES, REFUND ISSUES)] BARRIERS HAVE A NOTABLE NEGATIVE IMPACT ON USAGE-INTENTION.

THIS CAN LIMIT THE USABILITY OF SYSTEMWIDE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD DATA FOR SEXUAL MINORITY RESEARCH. ONE VIABLE RESOURCE MIGHT BE THE DOCUMENTATION OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION WITHIN CLINICAL NOTES. THE AUTHORS DEVELOPED AN APPROACH TO IDENTIFY SEXUAL ORIENTATION DOCUMENTATION AND SUBSEQUENTLY DERIVED A COHORT OF SEXUAL MINORITY PATIENTS USING CLINICAL NOTES FROM THE VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD. METHODS: A HYBRID NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING APPROACH WAS DEVELOPED AND USED TO IDENTIFY AND CATEGORIZE INSTANCES OF TERMS AND PHRASES RELATED TO SEXUAL ORIENTATION IN VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION CLINICAL NOTES FROM 2000 TO 2019. SYSTEM PERFORMANCE WAS ASSESSED WITH POSITIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE AND SENSITIVITY. DATA WERE ANALYZED IN 2019. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 2,413,584 SEXUAL MINORITY TERMS/PHRASES WERE FOUND WITHIN CLINICAL NOTES, OF WHICH 439,039 (18%) WERE FOUND TO BE RELATED TO PATIENT SEXUAL ORIENTATION WITH A POSITIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE OF 85.9%. DOCUMENTATION OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION WAS FOUND FOR 115,312 PATIENTS. WHEN COMPARED WITH 2,262 PATIENTS WITH A RECORD OF ADMINISTRATIVE CODING FOR HOMOSEXUALITY, THE SYSTEM FOUND MENTIONS OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION FOR 1,808 PATIENTS (79.9% SENSITIVITY). CONCLUSIONS: WHEN SYSTEMWIDE STRUCTURED DATA ARE UNAVAILABLE OR INCONSISTENT, DERIVING A COHORT OF SEXUAL MINORITY PATIENTS IN ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS FOR RESEARCH IS POSSIBLE AND PERMITS LONGITUDINAL ANALYSIS ACROSS MULTIPLE CLINICAL DOMAINS. ALTHOUGH LIMITATIONS AND CHALLENGES TO THE APPROACH WERE IDENTIFIED, THIS STUDY MAKES AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD FOR THE VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION SEXUAL MINORITY RESEARCH, AND THE METHODOLOGY CAN BE APPLIED IN OTHER HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATIONS.

CONVERSATIONAL AGENTS TYPICALLY IMITATE HUMAN CONVERSATION BY APPLYING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING AND MACHINE LEARNING AND STAND IN CONTRAST TO TEXT-BASED ENGAGEMENT PLATFORMS THAT ACCEPT DISCRETELY FORMATTED HUMAN INPUTS AND REPLY WITH PRESET MESSAGES. CONVERSATIONAL AGENTS ARE NOW FAMILIAR TOOLS IN CONSUMER LIFE (EG, BILLING ISSUES). THEY HAVE INCREASINGLY BECOME MORE COMMON IN HEALTH CARE SPACES, ESPECIALLY DURING THE CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) PANDEMIC, AS WELL AS IN DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER OR CLINICAL CAPACITIES. CONVERSATIONAL AGENTS ARE JUST BEGINNING IN CLINICAL PRACTICE SETTINGS, WITH COVID-19 SPURRING GREATER INTEREST IN THIS FIELD. THE USE OF CAS MAY IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES AND LOWER COSTS. RESEARCHERS AND DEVELOPERS, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH PATIENTS AND CLINICIANS, SHOULD RIGOROUSLY EVALUATE THESE PROGRAMS. FURTHER CONSIDERATION AND INVESTIGATION INVOLVING CAS AND RELATED TECHNOLOGIES WILL BE NECESSARY, NOT ONLY TO DETERMINE THEIR POTENTIAL BENEFITS BUT ALSO TO ESTABLISH TRANSPARENCY, APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT, AND SAFETY.

A CLASSIC SETTING OF THE TASK MAINLY INVOLVES CLASSIFYING THE OVERALL SENTIMENT POLARITY OF THE INPUTS. HOWEVER, IT IS BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE SENTIMENT EXPRESSED IN A SENTENCE IS UNIFIED AND CONSISTENT, WHICH DOES NOT HOLD IN THE REALITY. AS A FINE-GRAINED ALTERNATIVE OF THE TASK, ANALYZING THE SENTIMENT TOWARDS A SPECIFIC TARGET AND ASPECT HAS DRAWN MUCH ATTENTION FROM THE COMMUNITY FOR ITS MORE PRACTICAL ASSUMPTION THAT SENTIMENT IS DEPENDENT ON A PARTICULAR SET OF ASPECTS AND ENTITIES. RECENTLY, DEEP NEURAL MODELS HAVE ACHIEVED GREAT SUCCESSES ON SENTIMENT ANALYSIS. AS A FUNCTIONAL SIMULATION OF THE BEHAVIOR OF HUMAN BRAINS AND ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL DEEP NEURAL MODELS FOR SEQUENTIAL DATA, LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (LSTM) NETWORKS ARE EXCELLENT IN LEARNING IMPLICIT KNOWLEDGE FROM DATA. HOWEVER, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR LSTM TO ACQUIRE EXPLICIT KNOWLEDGE SUCH AS COMMONSENSE FACTS FROM THE TRAINING DATA FOR ACCOMPLISHING THEIR SPECIFIC TASKS. ON THE OTHER HAND, EMERGING KNOWLEDGE BASES HAVE BROUGHT A VARIETY OF KNOWLEDGE RESOURCES TO OUR ATTENTION, AND IT HAS BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED THAT INCORPORATING THE BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE IS AN IMPORTANT ADD-ON FOR MANY NLP TASKS. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A KNOWLEDGE-RICH SOLUTION TO TARGETED ASPECT-BASED SENTIMENT ANALYSIS WITH A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON LEVERAGING COMMONSENSE KNOWLEDGE IN THE DEEP NEURAL SEQUENTIAL MODEL. TO EXPLICITLY MODEL THE INFERENCE OF THE DEPENDENT SENTIMENT, WE AUGMENT THE LSTM WITH A STACKED ATTENTION MECHANISM CONSISTING OF ATTENTION MODELS FOR THE TARGET LEVEL AND SENTENCE LEVEL, RESPECTIVELY. IN ORDER TO EXPLICITLY INTEGRATE THE EXPLICIT KNOWLEDGE WITH IMPLICIT KNOWLEDGE, WE PROPOSE AN EXTENSION OF LSTM, TERMED SENTIC LSTM. THE EXTENDED LSTM CELL INCLUDES A SEPARATE OUTPUT GATE THAT INTERPOLATES THE TOKEN-LEVEL MEMORY AND THE CONCEPT-LEVEL INPUT. IN ADDITION, WE PROPOSE AN EXTENSION OF SENTIC LSTM BY CREATING A HYBRID OF THE LSTM AND A RECURRENT ADDITIVE NETWORK THAT SIMULATES SENTIC PATTERNS.

FOR BOTH, WE OBSERVED A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE EFFECT ON CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE DUE TO THE UNEVEN DISTRIBUTION OF CHARACTERISTIC LANGUAGE STRUCTURES WITHIN THE TEXT COLLECTION. FOR PROPORTIONAL CLASSIFICATION, THIS POSES CONSIDERABLE PROBLEMS. TO FIX THIS PROBLEM, WE PROPOSE A WORKFLOW OF ACTIVE LEARNING, WHICH ALTERNATES BETWEEN MACHINE LEARNING AND HUMAN CODING. RESULTS FROM EXPERIMENTS WITH EMPIRICAL DATA (POLITICAL MANIFESTOS) DEMONSTRATE THAT ACTIVE LEARNING ENABLES RESEARCHERS TO CREATE TRAINING SETS FOR AUTOMATIC CA EFFICIENTLY, RELIABLY, AND WITH HIGH ACCURACY FOR THE DESIRED GOAL WHILE RETAINING CONTROL OVER THE AUTOMATIC PROCESS.

IN ORDER TO LEARN AN ACCURATE DOMAIN-SPECIFIC SENTIMENT CLASSIFIER, A LARGE NUMBER OF LABELED SAMPLES ARE NEEDED, WHICH ARE EXPENSIVE AND TIME-CONSUMING TO ANNOTATE. MULTI-DOMAIN SENTIMENT ANALYSIS BASED ON MULTI-TASK LEARNING CAN LEVERAGE LABELED SAMPLES IN EACH SINGLE DOMAIN, WHICH CAN ALLEVIATE THE NEED FOR LARGE AMOUNT OF LABELED DATA IN ALL DOMAINS. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A DOMAIN ATTENTION MODEL FOR MULTI-DOMAIN SENTIMENT ANALYSIS. IN OUR APPROACH, THE DOMAIN REPRESENTATION IS USED AS ATTENTION TO SELECT THE MOST DOMAIN-RELATED FEATURES IN EACH DOMAIN. THE DOMAIN REPRESENTATION IS OBTAINED THROUGH AN AUXILIARY DOMAIN CLASSIFICATION TASK, WHICH WORKS AS DOMAIN REGULARIZER. IN THIS WAY, BOTH SHARED AND DOMAIN-SPECIFIC FEATURES FOR SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION ARE EXTRACTED SIMULTANEOUSLY.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THIS STUDY USED A MIXED-METHOD APPROACH, USING A BRAND SITUATION AS A CASE EXAMPLE, INCLUDING SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF SOCIAL MEDIA CONVERSATIONS AND SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF MEDIA COVERAGE. THIS STUDY TRACKS THE DIFFUSION OF A FALSE CLAIM ABOUT THE BRAND VIA ONLINE MEDIA COVERAGE, SUBSEQUENT SPREADING OF THE FALSE CLAIM VIA SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE RESULTING IMPACT ON SENTIMENT TOWARD THE BRAND. FINDINGS: THE FINDINGS ILLUSTRATE THE INFLUENCE OF DIGITAL MASS COMMUNICATION SOURCES ON THE SUBSEQUENT SPREAD OF INFORMATION ABOUT A BRAND VIA SOCIAL MEDIA CHANNELS AND THE IMPACT OF THE SOCIAL SPREAD OF FALSE CLAIMS ON BRAND SENTIMENT. THIS STUDY ILLUSTRATES THE VALUE OF SOCIAL MEDIA LISTENING AND SENTIMENT ANALYSIS FOR BRANDS AS AN ONGOING BUSINESS PRACTICE. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: WHILE IT HAS LONG BEEN KNOWN THAT MEDIA COVERAGE IS IN PART SUBSEQUENTLY DIFFUSED THROUGH INDIVIDUAL SHARING, THIS STUDY REVEALS THE POTENTIAL FOR MEDIA SENTIMENT TO INFLUENCE SENTIMENT TOWARD A BRAND. IT ALSO ILLUSTRATES THE POTENTIAL HARM BRANDS FACE WHEN FALSE INFORMATION IS SPREAD VIA MEDIA COVERAGE AND SUBSEQUENTLY THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS AND CONVERSATIONS. HOW BRANDS CAN MOST EFFECTIVELY CORRECT FALSE BRAND BELIEFS AND RECOVER FROM NEGATIVE SENTIMENT RELATED TO FALSE CLAIMS IS AN AREA FOR FUTURE RESEARCH. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT BRANDS ARE WISE TO USE SENTIMENT ANALYSIS AS PART OF THEIR EVALUATION OF EARNED MEDIA COVERAGE FROM NEWS ORGANIZATIONS AND TO USE SOCIAL LISTENING AS AN ALERT SYSTEM AND SENTIMENT ANALYSIS TO ASSESS IMPACT ON ATTITUDES TOWARD THE BRAND. THESE STEPS SHOULD BECOME PART OF A BRANDS SOCIAL MEDIA MANAGEMENT PROCESS. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS: MEDIA ARE PRESUMED TO BE IMPARTIAL REPORTERS OF NEWS AND INFORMATION. HOWEVER, THIS STUDY ILLUSTRATED THAT THE SENTIMENT EXPRESSED IN MEDIA COVERAGE ABOUT A BRAND CAN BE MEASURED AND DIFFUSED BEYOND THE PUBLICATIONS INITIAL REACH VIA SOCIAL MEDIA. ADVERTISING POSITIONED AS NEWS MUST BE LABELED AS 'ADVERTORIAL' TO ENSURE THAT THOSE EXPOSED TO THE MESSAGE UNDERSTAND THAT THE MESSAGE IS NOT IMPARTIAL. NEWS ORGANIZATIONS MAY INADVERTENTLY PUBLISH FALSE CLAIMS AND RELAY INFORMATION WITH SENTIMENT THAT IS THEN CARRIED VIA SOCIAL MEDIA ALONG WITH THE INFORMATION ITSELF. NEGATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT A BRAND MAY BE MORE SENSATIONAL AND, THUS, PRONE TO SOCIAL SHARING, NO MATTER HOW WELL THE FINDINGS ARE RESEARCHED OR SOURCED. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THE VALUE OF THE STUDY IS ITS ILLUSTRATION OF HOW FALSE INFORMATION AND MEDIA SENTIMENT SPREAD VIA SOCIAL MEDIA CAN ULTIMATELY AFFECT CONSUMER SENTIMENT AND ATTITUDE TOWARD THE BRAND.

COMPLEX BEHAVIORS ARE NATURAL CANDIDATES FOR THIS. IN PARTICULAR, RECENT STUDIES HAVE SUGGESTED THAT SPEECH ALTERATIONS MIGHT BE ONE OF THE EARLIEST SIGNS OF COGNITIVE DECLINE, FREQUENTLY NOTICEABLE YEARS BEFORE OTHER COGNITIVE DEFICITS BECOME APPARENT. TRADITIONAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL LANGUAGE TESTS PROVIDE AMBIGUOUS RESULTS IN THIS CONTEXT. IN CONTRAST, THE ANALYSIS OF SPOKEN LANGUAGE PRODUCTIONS BY NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) TECHNIQUES CAN PINPOINT LANGUAGE MODIFICATIONS IN POTENTIAL PATIENTS. THIS INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDY AIMED AT USING NLP TO IDENTIFY EARLY LINGUISTIC SIGNS OF COGNITIVE DECLINE IN A POPULATION OF ELDERLY INDIVIDUALS. METHODS: WE ENROLLED 96 PARTICIPANTS (AGE RANGE 5075): 48 HEALTHY CONTROLS (CG) AND 48 COGNITIVELY IMPAIRED PARTICIPANTS: 16 PARTICIPANTS WITH SINGLE DOMAIN AMNESTIC MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT (AMCI), 16 WITH MULTIPLE DOMAIN MCI (MDMCI) AND 16 WITH EARLY DEMENTIA (ED). EACH SUBJECT UNDERWENT A BRIEF NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL SCREENING COMPOSED BY MMSE, MOCA, GPCOG, CDT, AND VERBAL FLUENCY (PHONEMIC AND SEMANTIC). THE SPONTANEOUS SPEECH DURING THREE TASKS (DESCRIBING A COMPLEX PICTURE, A TYPICAL WORKING DAY AND RECALLING A LAST REMEMBERED DREAM) WAS THEN RECORDED, TRANSCRIBED AND ANNOTATED AT VARIOUS LINGUISTIC LEVELS. A MULTIDIMENSIONAL PARAMETER COMPUTATION WAS PERFORMED BY A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF SPOKEN TEXTS, COMPUTING RHYTHMIC, ACOUSTIC, LEXICAL, MORPHO-SYNTACTIC, AND SYNTACTIC FEATURES. RESULTS: NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CONTROLS AND MDMCI, AND BETWEEN CONTROLS AND ED PARTICIPANTS; GPCOG, MOCA, PF, AND SF ALSO DISCRIMINATED BETWEEN CONTROLS AND AMCI. IN THE LINGUISTIC EXPERIMENTS, A NUMBER OF FEATURES REGARDING LEXICAL, ACOUSTIC AND SYNTACTIC ASPECTS WERE SIGNIFICANT IN DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN MDMCI, ED, AND CG (NON-PARAMETRIC STATISTICAL ANALYSIS).

THE VISUAL ATTENTION NETWORK MAKES REGION FEATURES OF THE IMAGE INTERACT WITH MULTIPLE SEMANTIC LEVELS OF TEXT (WORD, PHRASE, AND SENTENCE) TO OBTAIN THE ATTENDED VISUAL FEATURES. THE SEMANTIC ATTENTION NETWORK MAKES SEMANTIC FEATURES OF THE TEXT INTERACT WITH MULTIPLE VISUAL LEVELS OF IMAGE (GLOBAL AND LOCAL) TO OBTAIN THE ATTENDED SEMANTIC FEATURES. THEN, THE ATTENDED VISUAL AND SEMANTIC FEATURES FROM THE TWO ATTENTION NETWORKS ARE UNIFIED INTO A HOLISTIC FRAMEWORK TO CONDUCT VISUAL-TEXTUAL SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION.

IN OUR PAPER, WE PROPOSE A METHOD BASED ON THE ENCODER-DECODER FRAMEWORK, NAMED REFERENCE BASED LONG SHORT TERM MEMORY (R-LSTM), AIMING TO LEAD THE MODEL TO GENERATE A MORE DESCRIPTIVE SENTENCE FOR THE GIVEN IMAGE BY INTRODUCING REFERENCE INFORMATION. SPECIFICALLY, WE ASSIGN DIFFERENT WEIGHTS TO THE WORDS ACCORDING TO THE CORRELATION BETWEEN WORDS AND IMAGES DURING THE TRAINING PHASE. WE ADDITIONALLY MAXIMIZE THE CONSENSUS SCORE BETWEEN THE CAPTIONS GENERATED BY THE CAPTIONING MODEL AND THE REFERENCE INFORMATION FROM THE NEIGHBORING IMAGES OF THE TARGET IMAGE, WHICH CAN REDUCE THE MISRECOGNITION PROBLEM.

CLARIFYING SUCH CONFUSIONS CAN HELP CONSUMERS REDUCE CONCERNS TO MAKE UP THEIR MIND FOR THEIR PURCHASES, THEREFORE BENEFITING BOTH CONSUMERS AND RETAILERS. THROUGH TEXT ANALYTICS AND SENTIMENT ANALYSIS, WE COMPARATIVELY EXAMINE THE UNDERLYING PATTERNS OF ONLINE CONSUMER REVIEWS OF THREE LARGE RETAILERS INCLUDING SEARS, HOME DEPOT, AND BEST BUY FOR A SAME PRODUCT. AFTERWARD, WE COMBINE ONLINE CONSUMER REVIEWS FROM THESE LARGE RETAILERS AND CONDUCT AN OVERALL TEXT ANALYTICS AND SENTIMENT ANALYSIS. THE OVERALL RESULTS ARE FURTHER COMPARED WITH THE RESULTS FROM INDIVIDUAL RETAILERS. THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT THE SENTIMENT OF THE ONLINE CONSUMER REVIEWS COULD VARY SUBSTANTIALLY SO RELYING ON A SINGLE DATA SOURCE TO MAKE PURCHASE DECISION IS NOT A WISE IDEA. BASED ON THE RESULTS, WE FURTHER DEVISE A FRAMEWORK TO COMPARATIVELY EXAMINE AND INTEGRATE MULTIPLE DATA SOURCES FOR SOCIAL MEDIA ANALYTICS OF ONLINE CONSUMER REVIEWS.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: TOURIST DESTINATIONS ARE INCREASINGLY AFFECTED BY TRAVEL-RELATED INFORMATION SHARED THROUGH THE WEB. MORE AND MORE PEOPLE FIRST CHECK THE PREVIOUS TRAVEL EXPERIENCES OF OTHER PEOPLE TO BUILD THEIR OWN DESTINATION IMAGE AND TO HELP THEM IN THEIR CHOICE OF DESTINATION. THIS PAPER ANALYSES THE SHARED OPINIONS RELATED TO THE CITY OF BARCELONA IN A WELL-KNOWN EWOM WEBSITE. THE REVIEWERS OPINION AND THE CREDIBILITY SOURCES OF EWOM ARE EXTRACTED FROM THE WEB USING A WEBSCRAPER, WHILE THE SENTIMENT SCORE TO ANALYSE THE DISCOURSE ORIENTATION (POSITIVE VS NEGATIVE) IS CALCULATED USING COMPUTER-BASED SENTIMENT ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES. FINDINGS: ONLINE REVIEWS USERS ARE RELUCTANT TO PROVIDE EXTREME POLAR OPINIONS (VERY NEGATIVE, VERY POSITIVE) TO ANY TRAVEL SUBCATEGORY (HOTEL, RESTAURANT, ATTRACTIONS AND NIGHT-LIFE) OF A TOURIST DESTINATION. THE RESULTS OBTAINED ALSO REVEAL THAT EWOMS PERCEIVED HELPFULNESS GROWS WITH THE EXPERTISE OF THE REVIEWER. HOWEVER, THE HELPFULNESS SCORE GIVEN TO THE REVIEWS POSTED IS NOT INFLUENCED BY THE SENTIMENT ORIENTATION OF THE AUTHORS OPINION. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: THIS RESEARCH IS LIMITED TO THE CASE STUDY OF CIAO, WHICH IS A WELL-KNOWN CONSUMER PLATFORM, AND THE CITY OF BARCELONA, WHICH IS A TOP TOURISTIC DESTINATION. HOWEVER, THE APPROACH PROPOSED CAN BE EASILY EXTENDED TO OTHER SIMILAR CONSUMER PLATFORMS AND CITIES USING THE SAME METHODOLOGY. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: UNDERSTANDING THE INFORMATION POSTED IN THE MEDIA ENVIRONMENT IS A MAJOR CONCERN IN THE FIELD OF MARKETING DESTINATION PLANNING. POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EWOM OFFERS POTENTIAL CONSUMERS A CLEAR PICTURE ON THE TOURIST DESTINATION, AND THIS INFORMATION CAN BE USED BY DESTINATION MARKETING ORGANISATIONS TO MEET CUSTOMERS NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH AND REVIEW ON MTT STUDIES INCLUDING 'METRIC' OR 'INTERVAL SCALE' WAS PERFORMED IN THE HEALTH AND SOCIAL SCIENCES LITERATURE. THE SEARCH WAS RESTRICTED TO 20012005 AND 20112015. A TEXT MINING ALGORITHM WAS EMPLOYED TO OPERATIONALIZE THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND TO EXPLORE THE USES OF 'METRIC'. THE PARADIGM OF EACH INCLUDED ARTICLE (RASCH MEASUREMENT THEORY (RMT), ITEM RESPONSE THEORY (IRT) OR BOTH), AS WELL AS ITS TYPE (THEORETICAL, METHODOLOGICAL, TEACHING, APPLICATION, MISCELLANEOUS) WERE DETERMINED. AN INDUCTIVE THEMATIC ANALYSIS ON THE FIRST THREE TYPES WAS PERFORMED. RESULTS: 70.6% OF THE 1337 INCLUDED ARTICLES WERE ALLOCATED TO RMT, AND 68.4% WERE APPLICATION PAPERS. AMONG THE NUMBER OF USES OF 'METRIC', IT WAS PREDOMINANTLY A SYNONYM OF 'SCALE'; AS ADJECTIVE, IT REFERRED TO MEASUREMENT OR QUANTIFICATION. THREE INCOMPATIBLE THEMES 'ONLY RMT/ALL MTT/NO MTT MODELS CAN PROVIDE INTERVAL MEASURES' WERE IDENTIFIED, BUT 'INTERVAL SCALE' WAS CONSIDERABLY MORE MENTIONED IN RMT THAN IN IRT. CONCLUSION: 'METRIC' IS USED IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS, AND THERE IS NO CONSENSUS ON WHICH MTT METRIC HAS INTERVAL SCALE PROPERTIES. NEVERTHELESS, WHEN USING THE TERM 'METRIC', THE AUTHORS SHOULD SPECIFY THE LEVEL OF THE METRIC BEING USED (ORDINAL, ORDERED, INTERVAL, RATIO), AND JUSTIFY WHY ACCORDING TO THEM THE METRIC IS AT THAT LEVEL.

IN THIS PAPER, WE HAVE: A) STUDIED THE EFFECT OF INCREASING THE SIZE OF TRAINING DATA ON THE PREDICTION PERFORMANCE OF THREE CLASSICAL ML MODELS: MULTINOMIAL NAVE BAYES (MNB), SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM) AND LOGISTIC REGRESSION (LR), AND B) STUDIED THE EFFECT OF FILTERING BASED ON PREDICTION STRENGTH OF LR MODEL WHEN THE MODEL IS TRAINED ON VERY-SMALL (10,000 CASES) AND VERY-LARGE (450,000 CASES) TRAINING SETS. METHOD: DATA FROM QUEENSLAND INJURY SURVEILLANCE UNIT FROM YEARS 20022012, WHICH WAS CATEGORIZED INTO 20 BROAD E-CODES WAS USED FOR THIS STUDY. ELEVEN RANDOMLY CHOSEN TRAINING SETS OF SIZE RANGING FROM 10,000 TO 450,000 CASES WERE USED TO TRAIN THE ML MODELS, AND THE PREDICTION PERFORMANCE WAS ANALYZED ON A PREDICTION SET OF 50,150 CASES. FILTERING APPROACH WAS TESTED ON LR MODELS TRAINED ON SMALLEST AND LARGEST TRAINING DATASETS. SENSITIVITY WAS USED AS THE PERFORMANCE MEASURE FOR INDIVIDUAL CATEGORIES. WEIGHTED AVERAGE SENSITIVITY (WAVG) AND UNWEIGHTED AVERAGE SENSITIVITY (UAVG) WERE USED AS THE MEASURES OF OVERALL PERFORMANCE. FILTERING APPROACH WAS ALSO TESTED FOR ESTIMATING CATEGORY COUNTS AND WAS COMPARED WITH APPROACHES OF SUMMING PREDICTION PROBABILITIES AND COUNTING DIRECT PREDICTIONS BY ML MODEL. RESULTS: THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF ALL THREE ML MODELS IMPROVED WITH INCREASE IN THE SIZE OF TRAINING DATA. THE OVERALL SENSITIVITIES WITH MAXIMUM TRAINING SIZE FOR LR AND SVM MODELS WERE SIMILAR (82%), AND HIGHER THAN MNB (76%). FOR ALL THE ML MODELS, THE SENSITIVITIES OF RARE CATEGORIES IMPROVED WITH INCREASING TRAINING DATA BUT THEY WERE CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN SENSITIVITIES OF LARGER CATEGORIES. WITH INCREASING TRAINING DATA SIZE, LR AND SVM EXHIBITED DIMINISHING IMPROVEMENT IN UAVG WHEREAS THE IMPROVEMENT WAS RELATIVELY STEADY IN CASE OF MNB. FILTERING BASED ON PREDICTION STRENGTH OF LR MODEL (AND MANUAL REVIEW OF FILTERED CASES) HELPED IN IMPROVING THE SENSITIVITIES OF RARE CATEGORIES. A SIZEABLE PORTION OF CASES STILL NEEDED TO BE FILTERED EVEN WHEN THE LR MODEL WAS TRAINED ON VERY LARGE TRAINING SET. FOR ESTIMATING CATEGORY COUNTS, FILTERING APPROACH PROVIDED BEST ESTIMATES FOR MOST E-CODES AND SUMMING PREDICTION PROBABILITIES APPROACH PROVIDED BETTER ESTIMATES FOR RARE CATEGORIES. CONCLUSIONS: INCREASING THE SIZE OF TRAINING DATA ALONE CANNOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF POOR CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE ON RARE CATEGORIES BY ML MODELS.

THIS IS USUALLY ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE USE OF SUPERVISED AND UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS THAT LEARN FROM THE AVAILABLE DATA. HOWEVER, THESE ARE USUALLY HIGHLY COMPUTATIONALLY EXPENSIVE, EITHER IN THE TRAINING OR IN THE PREDICTION PHASE, AS THEY ARE OFTEN NOT ABLE TO HANDLE CURRENT DATA VOLUMES. PARALLEL APPROACHES HAVE BEEN PROPOSED IN ORDER TO BOOST PROCESSING SPEEDS, BUT THIS CLEARLY REQUIRES TECHNOLOGIES THAT SUPPORT DISTRIBUTED COMPUTATIONS. METHODS: EXTREME LEARNING MACHINES (ELMS) ARE AN EMERGING LEARNING PARADIGM, PRESENTING AN EFFICIENT UNIFIED SOLUTION TO GENERALIZED FEED-FORWARD NEURAL NETWORKS. ELM OFFERS SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES SUCH AS FAST LEARNING SPEED, EASE OF IMPLEMENTATION, AND MINIMAL HUMAN INTERVENTION. HOWEVER, ELM CANNOT BE EASILY PARALLELIZED, DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF A PSEUDO-INVERSE CALCULATION. THEREFORE, THIS PAPER AIMS TO FIND A RELIABLE METHOD TO REALIZE A PARALLEL IMPLEMENTATION OF ELM THAT CAN BE APPLIED TO LARGE DATASETS TYPICAL OF BIG DATA PROBLEMS WITH THE EMPLOYMENT OF THE MOST RECENT TECHNOLOGY FOR PARALLEL IN-MEMORY COMPUTATION, I.E., SPARK, DESIGNED TO EFFICIENTLY DEAL WITH ITERATIVE PROCEDURES THAT RECURSIVELY PERFORM OPERATIONS OVER THE SAME DATA. MOREOVER, THIS PAPER SHOWS HOW TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE MOST RECENT ADVANCES IN STATISTICAL LEARNING THEORY (SLT) IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF SELECTING ELM HYPERPARAMETERS THAT GIVE THE BEST GENERALIZATION PERFORMANCE. THIS INVOLVES ASSESSING THE PERFORMANCE OF SUCH ALGORITHMS (I.E., RESAMPLING METHODS AND IN-SAMPLE METHODS) BY EXPLOITING THE MOST RECENT RESULTS IN SLT AND ADAPTING THEM TO THE BIG DATA FRAMEWORK. THE PROPOSED APPROACH HAS BEEN TESTED ON TWO AFFECTIVE ANALOGICAL REASONING DATASETS. AFFECTIVE ANALOGICAL REASONING CAN BE DEFINED AS THE INTRINSICALLY HUMAN CAPACITY TO INTERPRET THE COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE INFORMATION ASSOCIATED WITH NATURAL LANGUAGE. IN PARTICULAR, WE EMPLOYED TWO BENCHMARKS, EACH ONE COMPOSED BY 21,743 COMMON-SENSE CONCEPTS; EACH CONCEPT IS REPRESENTED ACCORDING TO TWO MODELS OF A SEMANTIC NETWORK IN WHICH COMMON-SENSE CONCEPTS ARE LINKED TO A HIERARCHY OF AFFECTIVE DOMAIN LABELS. RESULTS: THE LABELED DATA HAVE BEEN SPLIT INTO TWO SETS: THE FIRST 20,000 SAMPLES HAVE BEEN USED FOR BUILDING THE MODEL WITH THE ELM WITH THE DIFFERENT SLT STRATEGIES, WHILE THE REST OF THE LABELED SAMPLES, NUMBERING 1743, HAVE BEEN KEPT APART AS REFERENCE SET IN ORDER TO TEST THE PERFORMANCE OF THE LEARNED MODEL. THE SPLITTING PROCESS HAS BEEN REPEATED 30 TIMES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN STATISTICALLY RELEVANT RESULTS. WE RAN THE EXPERIMENTS THROUGH THE USE OF THE GOOGLE CLOUD PLATFORM, IN PARTICULAR, THE GOOGLE COMPUTE ENGINE. WE EMPLOYED THE GOOGLE COMPUTE ENGINE PLATFORM WITH NM = 4 MACHINES WITH TWO CORES AND 1.8 GB OF RAM (MACHINE TYPE N1-HIGHCPU-2) AND AN HDD OF 30 GB EQUIPPED WITH SPARK. RESULTS ON THE AFFECTIVE DATASET BOTH SHOW THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROPOSED PARALLEL APPROACH AND UNDERLINE THE MOST SUITABLE SLT STRATEGIES FOR THE SPECIFIC BIG DATA PROBLEM.

THE METHOD PROVIDES AN UNBIASED ESTIMATE OF PAIRWISE JACCARD SIMILARITY, AND THE ESTIMATOR IS A LINEAR FUNCTION OF HAMMING DISTANCE, WHICH IS VERY SIMPLE. WE RIGOROUSLY ANALYZE THE VARIANCE OF ONE-BIT MIN-HASH (BITHASH), SHOWING THAT FOR HIGH JACCARD SIMILARITY. BITHASH MAY PROVIDE ACCURATE ESTIMATION, AND AS THE PAIRWISE JACCARD SIMILARITY INCREASES, THE VARIANCE RATIO OF BITHASH OVER THE ORIGINAL MIN-HASH DECREASES. FURTHERMORE, BITHASH COMPRESSES EACH DATA SAMPLE INTO A COMPACT BINARY HASH CODE WHILE PRESERVING THE PAIRWISE SIMILARITY OF THE ORIGINAL DATA. THE BINARY CODE CAN BE USED AS A COMPRESSED AND INFORMATIVE REPRESENTATION IN REPLACEMENT OF THE ORIGINAL DATA FOR SUBSEQUENT PROCESSING.

COMPARED TO THE CATEGORICAL APPROACH THAT FOCUSES ON SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION SUCH AS BINARY CLASSIFICATION (POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE), THE DIMENSIONAL APPROACH CAN PROVIDE MORE FINE-GRAINED SENTIMENT ANALYSIS. THEREFORE, RECENT STUDIES HAVE INVESTIGATED THE AUTOMATIC DEVELOPMENT OF AFFECTIVE LEXICONS WITH VA RATINGS BECAUSE SUCH RESOURCES ARE FUNDAMENTAL AND USEFUL FOR BUILDING DIMENSIONAL SENTIMENT APPLICATIONS. DUE TO THE LIMITED NUMBER OF VA LEXICONS, A CROSS-LINGUAL APPROACH HAS EMERGED THAT AIMS TO ESTIMATE THE VA RATINGS OF AFFECTIVE WORDS OF ONE LANGUAGE FROM THOSE OF ANOTHER LANGUAGE BASED ON LINEAR REGRESSION OR OTHER REGRESSION METHODS. HOWEVER, ONE OF THE MAJOR LIMITATIONS OF LINEAR REGRESSION IS THE UNDER-FITTING PROBLEM WHICH CAN CAUSE A POOR FIT BETWEEN THE ALGORITHM AND THE TRAINING DATA. TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM, THIS STUDY PROPOSES A LOCALLY WEIGHTED METHOD TO IMPROVE LINEAR REGRESSION FOR PREDICTING THE VALENCE-AROUSAL VALUES OF AFFECTIVE WORDS. THIS METHOD PERFORMS A REGRESSION AROUND THE POINT OF INTEREST USING ONLY TRAINING DATA THAT ARE 'LOCAL' TO THAT POINT, AND THUS CAN REDUCE THE IMPACT OF NOISE FROM UNRELATED TRAINING DATA.

THEREFORE, WE USED THE REAL STOCK MARKET DATA AS GROUND TRUTH FOR OUR TRUST MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. WE COLLECTED STOCK-RELATED DATA (TWEETS) FROM TWITTER, WHICH IS A VERY POPULAR MICRO-BLOGGING FORUM, TO SEE THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE TWITTER SENTIMENT VALENCE AND ABNORMAL STOCK RETURNS FOR EIGHT FIRMS IN THE S&P 500.

COMPARED WITH EXISTING WORKS, IN ADDITION TO ANALYZING AND ACCUMULATING TWEETS SENTIMENT, WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE SOURCE OF TWEETSTHEIR AUTHORS. AUTHORS ARE DIFFERENTIATED BY THEIR POWER OR REPUTATION IN THE WHOLE COMMUNITY, WHERE POWER IS DETERMINED BY THE USER-TO-USER TRUST NETWORK. TO VALIDATE OUR TRUST MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, WE DID THE PEARSON CORRELATION TEST FOR AN EIGHT MONTHS PERIOD (THE TRADING DAYS FROM 01/01/2015 THROUGH 08/31/2015). COMPARED WITH TREATING ALL THE AUTHORS EQUALLY IMPORTANT, OR WEIGHTING THEM BY THEIR NUMBER OF FOLLOWERS, OUR TRUST NETWORK BASED REPUTATION MECHANISM CAN AMPLIFY THE CORRELATION BETWEEN A SPECIFIC FIRMS TWITTER SENTIMENT VALENCE AND THE FIRMS STOCK ABNORMAL RETURNS. TO FURTHER CONSIDER THE POSSIBLE AUTO-CORRELATION PROPERTY OF ABNORMAL STOCK RETURNS, WE CONSTRUCTED A LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL, WHICH INCLUDES HISTORICAL STOCK ABNORMAL RETURNS, TO TEST THE RELATION BETWEEN THE TWITTER SENTIMENT VALENCE AND ABNORMAL STOCK RETURNS. AGAIN, OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT BY USING OUR TRUST NETWORK POWER BASED METHOD TO WEIGHT TWEETS, TWITTER SENTIMENT VALENCE REFLECT ABNORMAL STOCK RETURNS BETTER THAN TREATING ALL THE AUTHORS EQUALLY IMPORTANT OR WEIGHTING THEM BY THEIR NUMBER OF FOLLOWERS.

THROUGH A CASE STUDY EMPLOYING TEXT ANALYSIS OF INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPTS, WE REVEALED THE AUTHENTIC VOICES OF PARTICIPANTS AND GAINED A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF MOTIVATIONS FOR AND BARRIERS TO COURSE ENGAGEMENTS EXPERIENCED BY STUDENTS PARTICIPATING IN MASSIVE OPEN ONLINE COURSES (MOOCS).

THIRTY-SIX PARTICIPANTS IN THE COURSES WERE INTERVIEWED, AND THESE STUDENTS VARIED IN AGE, EXPERIENCE WITH THE SUBJECT MATTER, AND WORLDWIDE GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION. MOST OF THE INTERVIEWEE STATEMENTS WERE NEUTRAL IN ATTITUDE; SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF THE INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPTS REVEALED THAT 80 PERCENT OF THE STATEMENTS THAT WERE EITHER EXTREMELY POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE WERE FOUND TO BE POSITIVE RATHER THAN NEGATIVE, AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE AN OVERALL POSITIVE CLIMATE IS KNOWN TO CORRELATE WITH HIGHER ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT IN TRADITIONAL EDUCATION SETTINGS. WHEN DEMOGRAPHIC DATA WAS ADDED TO THE SENTIMENT ANALYSIS, STUDENTS WHO HAVE ALREADY EARNED BACHELOR'S DEGREES WERE FOUND TO BE MORE POSITIVE ABOUT THE COURSES THAN STUDENTS WITH EITHER MORE OR LESS FORMAL EDUCATION, AND THIS WAS A HIGHLY STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT RESULT. IN GENERAL, STUDENTS FROM AMERICA WERE MORE CRITICAL THAN STUDENTS FROM AFRICA AND ASIA, AND THE SENTIMENTS OF FEMALE PARTICIPANTS' COMMENTS WERE GENERALLY LESS POSITIVE THAN THOSE OF MALE PARTICIPANTS.

THE EFFICIENCY OF NLP TASKS, SUCH AS TEXT COMPREHENSION AND INFORMATION EXTRACTION, CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED WITH PROPER TEXTUAL REPRESENTATIONS. AS NEURAL NETWORKS ARE GRADUALLY APPLIED TO LEARN THE REPRESENTATION OF WORDS AND PHRASES, FAIRLY EFFICIENT MODELS OF LEARNING SHORT TEXT REPRESENTATIONS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED, SUCH AS THE CONTINUOUS BAG OF WORDS (CBOW) AND SKIP-GRAM MODELS, AND THEY HAVE BEEN EXTENSIVELY EMPLOYED IN A VARIETY OF NLP TASKS. BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEX STRUCTURE GENERATED BY THE LONGER TEXT LENGTHS, SUCH AS SENTENCES, ALGORITHMS APPROPRIATE FOR LEARNING SHORT TEXTUAL REPRESENTATIONS ARE NOT APPLICABLE FOR LEARNING LONG TEXTUAL REPRESENTATIONS. ONE METHOD OF LEARNING LONG TEXTUAL REPRESENTATIONS IS THE LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (LSTM) NETWORK, WHICH IS SUITABLE FOR PROCESSING SEQUENCES. HOWEVER, THE STANDARD LSTM DOES NOT ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THE PRIMARY SENTENCE STRUCTURE (SUBJECT, PREDICATE AND OBJECT), WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR FOR PRODUCING APPROPRIATE SENTENCE REPRESENTATIONS. TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE, THIS PAPER PROPOSES THE DEPENDENCY- BASED LSTM MODEL (D-LSTM). THE D-LSTM DIVIDES A SENTENCE REPRESENTATION INTO TWO PARTS: A BASIC COMPONENT AND A SUPPORTING COMPONENT. THE D-LSTM USES A PRE-TRAINED DEPENDENCY PARSER TO OBTAIN THE PRIMARY SENTENCE INFORMATION AND GENERATE SUPPORTING COMPONENTS, AND IT ALSO USES A STANDARD LSTM MODEL TO GENERATE THE BASIC SENTENCE COMPONENTS. A WEIGHT FACTOR THAT CAN ADJUST THE RATIO OF THE BASIC AND SUPPORTING COMPONENTS IN A SENTENCE IS INTRODUCED TO GENERATE THE SENTENCE REPRESENTATION. COMPARED WITH THE REPRESENTATION LEARNED BY THE STANDARD LSTM, THE SENTENCE REPRESENTATION LEARNED BY THE DLSTM CONTAINS A GREATER AMOUNT OF USEFUL INFORMATION.

HOWEVER, THE UN-SUPERVISED LEARNING APPROACH EMPLOYED IN PREVIOUS STUDIES IS BECOMING LESS EFFICIENT DUE TO DATA SPARSENESS, LOW ACCURACY DUE TO NON-CONSIDERATION OF EMOTICONS, MODIFIERS, AND PRESENCE OF DOMAIN SPECIFIC WORDS, AS THEY MAY RESULT IN INACCURATE CLASSIFICATION OF USERS' REVIEWS.

METHODS: ICD-9 AND CURRENT PROCEDURAL TERMINOLOGY CODES WERE USED TO OBTAIN AN INITIAL DATA MART OF POTENTIAL ANEURYSM PATIENTS FROM THE EMR. NLP WAS THEN USED TO TRAIN A CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHM WITH .632 BOOTSTRAP CROSS-VALIDATION USED FOR CORRECTION OF OVERFITTING BIAS. THE CLASSIFICATION RULE WAS THEN APPLIED TO THE FULL DATA MART. ADDITIONAL VALIDATION WAS PERFORMED ON 300 PATIENTS CLASSIFIED AS HAVING ANEURYSMS. CONTROLS WERE OBTAINED BY MATCHING AGE, SEX, RACE, AND HEALTHCARE USE. RESULTS: WE IDENTIFIED 55,675 PATIENTS OF 4.2 MILLION PATIENTS WITH ICD-9 AND CURRENT PROCEDURAL TERMINOLOGY CODES CONSISTENT WITH CEREBRAL ANEURYSMS. OF THOSE, 16,823 PATIENTS HAD THE TERM ANEURYSM OCCUR NEAR RELEVANT ANATOMIC TERMS.

THERE EXISTS A NEED TO IDENTIFY EFFECTIVE AAC STRATEGIES AND TOOLS FOR INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING PRIMARY PROGRESSIVE APHASIA (PPA), A NEURODEGENERATIVE DEMENTIA, FOR WHICH COMPENSATORY TREATMENT PARADIGMS ARE YET TO BE SYSTEMATICALLY EVALUATED. AIMS: TO EXAMINE THE TREATMENT EFFECTS OF A NOVEL LANGUAGE COMPENSATION TOOL, COCHAT, AND TO DETERMINE IF LEXICAL RETRIEVAL SKILLS IMPROVE ARE MAINTAINED DURING ACTIVITY RETELL WITH USE OF THIS AAC APPLICATION. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: SIX INDIVIDUALS WITH PPA PARTICIPATED. THE STUDY WAS IMPLEMENTED USING A SINGLE-SUBJECT ALTERNATING TREATMENTS EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN TO COMPARE LEXICAL RETRIEVAL DURING ACTIVITY RETELL IN THREE CONDITIONS: ABSENCE OF TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT, PRESENCE OF PHOTOS ONLY, AND PRESENCE OF COCHAT APP, WITH PHOTO AND LABELS. THE NUMBER OF TARGET WORDS PRODUCED BY THE PARTICIPANT DURING ACTIVITY RETELL WITH A CONVERSATION PARTNER WAS THE PRIMARY DEPENDENT VARIABLE. THERE WERE TWO PHASES OF THIS EXPERIMENT: THREE CONDITIONS PRESENTED IN A FIXED-ORDER AND THREE CONDITIONS PRESENTED IN A COUNTERBALANCED ORDER. FOR ONE PARTICIPANT, AN ADDITIONAL IMPLEMENTATION OF COCHAT WAS PILOTED AT 6- AND 9-MONTH POST-INTERVENTION TO EXAMINE SUSTAINED EFFECT OF COCHAT DURING ACTIVITY RETELL. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: IN THE FIXED-ORDER PHASE, RESULTS INDICATED A HIGHER NUMBER OF TARGET WORDS PRODUCED IN THE COCHAT CONDITION FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS.

BY ANALYZING TRIPADVISOR HOTEL REVIEW DATA IN LOS ANGELES, WE ESTIMATE A MIXED-EFFECTS ORDERED LOGIT MODEL TO UNDERSTAND THE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE SLEEP QUALITY AS WELL AS THE HOTEL SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT AS INDICATED BY SENTIMENT ANALYSIS. THE RESULTS VALIDATE OUR PROPOSED CONCEPTUAL MODEL. HOTEL SLEEP QUALITY IS FOUND TO VARY BY AGE, GENDER, TRAVELER TYPE, AND REVIEW EXPERIENCE. IN ADDITION, HOTEL STAR RATING, NEARBY RESTAURANT DENSITY, NUMBER OF HOTEL FLOORS, AND THE HOTEL SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT ALSO INFLUENCE HOTEL SLEEP QUALITY.

MOST OFTEN, THE REASON FOR THIS SITUATION IS THE ABSENCE OF SPECIFIC TERMS IN THE SENTIMENT LEXICON REQUIRED IN THE CLASSIFICATION EFFORT. IN SUCH CASES, THERE WERE ONLY TWO POSSIBLE PATHS TO FOLLOW: (1) ADD TERMS TO THE LEXICON (OFF-LINE PROCESS) BY HUMAN INTERVENTION TO GUARANTEE NO NOISE IS INTRODUCED INTO THE LEXICON, WHICH PREVENTS THE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM TO PROVIDE AN IMMEDIATE ANSWER; OR (2) USE THE SERVICES OF A WORD-FREQUENCY DICTIONARY (ON-LINE PROCESS), WHICH IS COMPUTATIONALLY COSTLY TO BUILD. THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO COMPENSATE FOR THE LACK OF ABILITY OF A LEXICON-BASED METHOD TO PRODUCE A CLASSIFICATION OUTPUT. THE METHOD IS BASED ON THE COMBINATION OF THE CLASSIFICATION OUTPUTS OF NON LEXICON-BASED TOOLS. SPECIFICALLY, FIRSTLY THE OUTCOME VALUES OF APPLYING TWO OR MORE NON-LEXICON CLASSIFICATION METHODS ARE OBTAINED. SECONDLY, THESE NON-LEXICON OUTCOMES ARE FUSED USING A UNINORM BASED APPROACH, WHICH HAS BEEN PROVED TO HAVE DESIRABLE COMPENSATION PROPERTIES AS REQUIRED IN THE SA CONTEXT, TO GENERATE THE CLASSIFICATION OUTPUT THE LEXICON BASED APPROACH IS UNABLE TO ACHIEVE. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS BASED ON THE EXECUTION OF TWO WELL-KNOWN SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS, NAMELY NAVE BAYES AND MAXIMUM ENTROPY, AND THE APPLICATION OF A CROSS-RATIO UNINORM OPERATOR ARE PRESENTED.

CHIPOTLE) DURING A CRISIS, AND THE EFFECTS OF CORPORATE APOLOGY ON THOSE SENTIMENTS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: USING A VERY LARGE DATA SET OF TWEETS (I.E. OVER 2.6M) ABOUT COMPANY AS FOOD POISONING CASE (20152016). THIS CASE WAS SELECTED BECAUSE IT IS WIDELY KNOWN, DREW ATTENTION FROM VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS AND HAD MANY DYNAMICS (E.G. MULTIPLE OUTBREAKS, AND ACROSS DIFFERENT LOCATIONS). THIS STUDY EMPLOYED A SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH. ITS SENTIMENT POLARITY CLASSIFICATION AND RELEVANCE CLASSIFICATION CONSISTED OF FIVE STEPS: SAMPLING, LABELING, TOKENIZATION, AUGMENTATION OF SEMANTIC REPRESENTATION, AND THE TRAINING OF SUPERVISED CLASSIFIERS FOR RELEVANCE AND SENTIMENT PREDICTION. FINDINGS: THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT: THE OVERALL SENTIMENT OF TWEETS SPECIFIC TO THE CRISIS WAS NEUTRAL; PROMOTIONS AND MARKETING COMMUNICATION MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN CONVERTING NEGATIVE SENTIMENTS TO POSITIVE SENTIMENTS; A CORPORATE CRISIS DREW PUBLIC ATTENTION AND SPARKED PUBLIC DISCUSSION ON SOCIAL MEDIA; WHILE CORPORATE APOLOGIES HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT ON SENTIMENTS, THE EFFECT DID NOT LAST LONG, AS THE APOLOGIES DID NOT REMOVE PUBLIC CONCERNS ABOUT FOOD SAFETY; AND SOME TWITTER USERS EXERTED A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON ONLINE SENTIMENTS THROUGH THEIR POPULAR TWEETS, WHICH WERE HEAVILY RETWEETED AMONG TWITTER USERS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: EVEN WITH MULTIPLE TRAINING SESSIONS AND THE USE OF A VOTING PROCEDURE (I.E. WHEN THERE WAS A DISCREPANCY IN THE CODING OF A TWEET), THERE WERE SOME TWEETS THAT COULD NOT BE ACCURATELY CODED FOR SENTIMENT. ASPECT-BASED SENTIMENT ANALYSIS AND DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS CAN BE USED TO ADDRESS THIS LIMITATION IN FUTURE RESEARCH. THIS ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF CHIPOTLES APOLOGIES ON SENTIMENT DID NOT TEST FOR A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP. FUTURE RESEARCH COULD USE MANUAL CODING TO INCLUDE ONLY SPECIFIC RESPONSES TO THE CORPORATE APOLOGY. THERE WAS A DELAY BETWEEN THE TIME SOCIAL MEDIA USERS RECEIVED THE NEWS AND THE TIME THEY RESPONDED TO IT. TIME DELAY POSES A CHALLENGE TO THE SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF TWITTER DATA, AS IT IS DIFFICULT TO INTERPRET WHICH PEAK CORRESPONDS WITH WHICH INCIDENT/S. THIS STUDY FOCUSED SOLELY ON TWITTER, WHICH IS JUST ONE OF SEVERAL SOCIAL MEDIA SITES THAT HAD CONTENT ABOUT THE CRISIS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: FIRST, COMPANIES SHOULD USE SOCIAL MEDIA AS OFFICIAL CORPORATE NEWS CHANNELS AND FREQUENTLY UPDATE THEM WITH ANY DEVELOPMENTS ABOUT THE CRISIS, AND USE THEM PROACTIVELY. SECOND, COMPANIES IN CRISIS SHOULD REFRAIN FROM MARKETING EFFORTS. INSTEAD, THEY SHOULD FOCUS ON RESOLVING THE ISSUE AT HAND AND NOT ATTEMPT TO REGAIN A FAVORABLE RELATIONSHIP WITH STAKEHOLDERS RIGHT AWAY. THIRD, COMPANIES CAN LEVERAGE VIDEO, IMAGES AND HUMOR, AS WELL AS INDIVIDUALS WITH LARGE ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKS TO INCREASE THE REACH AND DIFFUSION OF THEIR MESSAGES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THIS STUDY IS AMONG THE FIRST TO EMPIRICALLY INVESTIGATE THE DYNAMICS OF CORPORATE REPUTATION AS IT EVOLVES DURING A CRISIS AS WELL AS THE EFFECTS OF CORPORATE APOLOGY ON ONLINE SENTIMENTS. IT IS ALSO ONE OF THE FEW STUDIES THAT EMPLOYS SENTIMENT ANALYSIS USING A SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING METHOD IN THE AREA OF CORPORATE REPUTATION AND COMMUNICATION MANAGEMENT.

OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY DEVELOPED AND VALIDATED ONE OF THE FIRST AUTOMATED NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING APPLICATIONS TO EXTRACT WOUND INFORMATION (WOUND TYPE, PRESSURE ULCER STAGE, WOUND SIZE, ANATOMIC LOCATION, AND WOUND TREATMENT) FROM FREE TEXT CLINICAL NOTES. METHODS AND DESIGN: FIRST, TWO HUMAN ANNOTATORS MANUALLY REVIEWED A PURPOSEFUL TRAINING SAMPLE (N = 360) AND RANDOM TEST SAMPLE (N = 1100) OF CLINICAL NOTES (INCLUDING 50% DISCHARGE SUMMARIES AND 50% OUTPATIENT NOTES), IDENTIFIED WOUND CASES, AND CREATED A GOLD STANDARD DATASET. WE THEN TRAINED AND TESTED OUR NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING SYSTEM (KNOWN AS MTERMS) TO PROCESS THE WOUND INFORMATION. FINALLY, WE ASSESSED OUR AUTOMATED APPROACH BY COMPARING SYSTEM-GENERATED FINDINGS AGAINST THE GOLD STANDARD. WE ALSO COMPARED THE PREVALENCE OF WOUND CASES IDENTIFIED FROM FREE-TEXT DATA WITH CODED DIAGNOSES IN THE STRUCTURED DATA. RESULTS: THE TESTING DATASET INCLUDED 101 NOTES (9.2%) WITH WOUND INFORMATION.

LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION PROVED SUCCESSFUL IN TRANSFORMING THE TOPICS OF TEXTS INTO VALUES AS A BASIS FOR REPRESENTING COGNITIVE INFORMATION GRAPHICALLY. THE VECTOR SPACE MODEL WITH EUCLIDIAN DISTANCE BASED CLUSTERING PROVED TO BE PARTICULARLY WELL SUITED FOR DETECTING TEXT DIFFERENCES AS A BASIS FOR GROUP FORMATION. THE SUBSEQUENT EVALUATION OF THE GRT WITH 54 HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS FURTHER CONFIRMED THE GRTS IMPACT ON LEARNING SUPPORT: STUDENTS WHO USED THE TOOL ADDED TWICE AS MANY CONCEPTS IN AN ESSAY AFTER DISCUSSING AS THOSE IN THE UNSUPPORTED GROUP.

THIS RESEARCH AIMS AT PROPOSING A SYSTEMATIC PROCESS TO CONSTRUCT A BIOMIMICRYBASED TRIZ CONTRADICTION MATRIX THAT CAN BE UTILIZED TO DEVISE INNOVATIVE IDEAS FOR NEW TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT BY SOLVING A CONTRADICTORY PROBLEM BASED ON BIOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS. TO BUILD A CONTRADICTION MATRIX THAT REFLECTS BOTH TECHNOLOGICAL AND BIOLOGICAL VIEWS, INVENTIVE PRINCIPLES IN BIOMIMICRY FIELDS ARE EXTRACTED BY TEXT MINING AND MATCHED IN A CELL OF AN EXISTING TRIZ CONTRADICTION MATRIX BY LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION (LDA). IN ADDITION, A BIOMIMICRYBASED TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PROCESS IS SUGGESTED BY USING 40 INVENTIVE PRINCIPLES, 39 ENGINEERING PARAMETERS OF THE TRIZ CONTRADICTION MATRIX, AND BIOMIMICRY CASES. THE PROPOSED APPROACH CAN BE USED AS A TOOL TO ASSIST PRACTITIONERS IN SOLVING TECHNOLOGICAL PROBLEMS AND DEVELOPING NEW TECHNOLOGY BY CONSIDERING BIOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS AS WELL AS TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS.

IN THE LITERATURE, NO STUDY IS SOLELY FOCUSED ON HADITH FROM ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PERSPECTIVE, WHILE MANY NEW DEVELOPMENTS HAVE BEEN OVERLOOKED AND NEED TO BE HIGHLIGHTED. THEREFORE, THIS REVIEW ANALYZE ALL ACADEMIC JOURNAL AND CONFERENCE PUBLICATIONS THAT USING TWO MAIN METHODS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR HADITH TEXT: HADITH CLASSIFICATION AND MINING. ALL HADITH RELEVANT METHODS AND ALGORITHMS FROM THE LITERATURE ARE DISCUSSED AND ANALYZED IN TERMS OF FUNCTIONALITY, SIMPLICITY, F-SCORE AND ACCURACY. USING VARIOUS DIFFERENT HADITH DATASETS MAKES A DIRECT COMPARISON BETWEEN THE EVALUATION RESULTS IMPOSSIBLE. THEREFORE, WE HAVE RE-IMPLEMENTED AND EVALUATED THE METHODS USING A SINGLE DATASET (I.E. 3150 HADITHS FROM SAHIH AL-BUKHARI BOOK). THE RESULT OF EVALUATION ON THE CLASSIFICATION METHOD REVEALS THAT NEURAL NETWORKS CLASSIFY THE HADITH WITH 94 % ACCURACY. THIS IS BECAUSE NEURAL NETWORKS ARE CAPABLE OF HANDLING COMPLEX (HIGH DIMENSIONAL) INPUT DATA. THE HADITH MINING METHOD THAT COMBINES VECTOR SPACE MODEL, COSINE SIMILARITY, AND ENRICHED QUERIES OBTAINS THE BEST ACCURACY RESULT (I.E. 88 %) AMONG OTHER RE-EVALUATED HADITH MINING METHODS. THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT IN HADITH MINING METHODS IS QUERY EXPANSION SINCE THE QUERY MUST BE FITTED TO THE HADITH LINGO. THE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE BASED METHODS IS EVIDENT IN HADITH CLASSIFICATION AND MINING APPROACHES AND THIS ABSENCE CAN BE COVERED IN FUTURE WORKS USING KNOWLEDGE GRAPHS.

THE BIBLIOGRAPHY OF ALL RELEVANT ARTICLES WAS EXAMINED AND ASSOCIATED ARTICLES WERE IDENTIFIED USING A SNOWBALLING TECHNIQUE. SELECTION CRITERIA: FOR INCLUSION, ARTICLES WERE REQUIRED TO MEET THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA: (A) USED A HEALTH-RELATED DATABASE, (B) FOCUSED ON INJURY-RELATED CASES, AND USED MACHINE LEARNING APPROACHES TO ANALYSE TEXTUAL DATA. METHODS: THE PAPERS IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE SEARCH WERE SCREENED RESULTING IN 16 PAPERS SELECTED FOR REVIEW. ARTICLES WERE REVIEWED TO DESCRIBE THE DATABASES AND METHODOLOGY USED, THE STRENGTH AND LIMITATIONS OF DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES, AND QUALITY ASSURANCE APPROACHES USED.

THEREFORE, MANUAL CODING, ALTHOUGH RESOURCE-INTENSIVE, CANNOT BE ELIMINATED. WE PROPOSE A BAYESIAN DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM TO AUTOCODE A LARGE PORTION OF THE DATA, FILTER CASES FOR MANUAL REVIEW, AND ASSIST HUMAN CODERS BY PRESENTING THEM TOP K PREDICTION CHOICES AND A CONFUSION MATRIX OF PREDICTIONS FROM BAYESIAN MODELS. METHOD: WE STUDIED THE PREDICTION PERFORMANCE OF SINGLE-WORD (SW) AND TWO-WORD-SEQUENCE (TW) NAVE BAYES MODELS ON A SAMPLE OF DATA FROM THE 2011 SURVEY OF OCCUPATIONAL INJURY AND ILLNESS (SOII). WE USED THE AGREEMENT IN PREDICTION RESULTS OF SW AND TW MODELS, AND VARIOUS PREDICTION STRENGTH THRESHOLDS FOR AUTOCODING AND FILTERING CASES FOR MANUAL REVIEW. WE ALSO STUDIED THE SENSITIVITY OF THE TOP K PREDICTIONS OF THE SW MODEL, TW MODEL, AND SWTW COMBINATION, AND THEN COMPARED THE ACCURACY OF THE MANUALLY ASSIGNED CODES TO SOII DATA WITH THAT OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM. RESULTS: THE ACCURACY OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM, ASSUMING WELL-TRAINED CODERS REVIEWING A SUBSET OF ONLY 26% OF CASES FLAGGED FOR REVIEW, WAS ESTIMATED TO BE COMPARABLE (86.5%) TO THE ACCURACY OF THE ORIGINAL CODING OF THE DATA SET (RANGE: 73%86.8%). OVERALL, THE TW MODEL HAD HIGHER SENSITIVITY THAN THE SW MODEL, AND THE ACCURACY OF THE PREDICTION RESULTS INCREASED WHEN THE TWO MODELS AGREED, AND FOR HIGHER PREDICTION STRENGTH THRESHOLDS. THE SENSITIVITY OF THE TOP FIVE PREDICTIONS WAS 93%. CONCLUSIONS: THE PROPOSED SYSTEM SEEMS PROMISING FOR CODING INJURY DATA AS IT OFFERS COMPARABLE ACCURACY AND LESS MANUAL CODING. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: ACCURATE AND TIMELY CODED OCCUPATIONAL INJURY DATA IS USEFUL FOR SURVEILLANCE AS WELL AS PREVENTION ACTIVITIES THAT AIM TO MAKE WORKPLACES SAFER.

"1652","BALL L, 2016, ","HIGH-PROFILE TERRORIST ATTACKS IN THE NEW MILLENNIUM HAVE MADE COUNTER-TERRORISM A PRIORITY FOR MANY GOVERNMENTS. THE ABUNDANCE OF OPEN SOURCE INTELLIGENCE AVAILABLE AFTER THE 9/11/2001 ATTACK, FOR EXAMPLE, ENABLED A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THAT TERRORIST NETWORK. THE OPPORTUNITY, THUS, IS TO COLLECT VALUABLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE INFORMATION DURING THE PRE-ATTACK PHASE TO AID IN THE PREVENTION OF SUCH ATROCITIES IN THE FUTURE. THIS ARTICLE POSITIONS SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AS A KEY TOOL FOR THIS TYPE OF INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS, WITH EMPHASIS ON THE AUTOMATED EXTRACTION OF DATA RELEVANT TO THE STRUCTURAL ORGANISATION OF ITS ACTORS AND THE ATTRIBUTES OF THEIR RELATIONSHIPS IN THE NETWORK BY USING DATA AND TEXT MINING TECHNIQUES ON OPEN SOURCES. THE PROCESSES OUTLINED ARE VIEWED AS A LAYER THAT COULD COMPLEMENT AND HELP TO POPULATE A TERRORIST BEHAVIOURAL ACTIVITY MODEL SUCH AS WHERE THE RECOGNITION OF PRE-INCIDENT INDICATORS ARE LINKED TO THE LIKELIHOOD OF TERRORIST EVENTS.

THE INDICES COME FROM AN UPDATED VERSION OF THE TOOL FOR THE AUTOMATIC ANALYSIS OF LEXICAL SOPHISTICATION (TAALES) AND INCLUDE ASSOCIATIVE, LEXICAL, AND SEMANTIC MEASURES OF WORD CONTEXT. HUMAN RATINGS OF HOLISTIC LEXICAL PROFICIENCY WERE OBTAINED FOR A SPOKEN CORPUS OF 240 TRANSCRIBED TEXTS PRODUCED BY SECOND LANGUAGE (L2) ADULT ENGLISH LEARNERS AND NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKERS (NESS). CORRELATIONS BETWEEN LEXICAL PROFICIENCY SCORES FROM TRAINED HUMAN RATERS AND CONTEXTUAL INDICES WERE EXAMINED AND A REGRESSION ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED TO INVESTIGATE THE POTENTIAL FOR CONTEXTUAL INDICES TO PREDICT PROFICIENCY SCORES. FOUR INDICES ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 42% OF THE VARIANCE IN LEXICAL PROFICIENCY SCORES IN THE TRANSCRIBED SPEECH SAMPLES. THESE INDICES WERE RELATED TO ASSOCIATIVE, LEXICAL, AND SEMANTIC OPERATIONALIZATIONS OF WORD CONTEXT. THE FINDINGS DEMONSTRATE THAT COMPUTATIONAL MEASURES OF WORD CONTEXT CAN PREDICT HUMAN RATINGS OF LEXICAL PROFICIENCY AND SUGGEST THAT LEXICAL, SEMANTIC, AND ASSOCIATIVE CONTEXT EACH PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF LEXICAL PROFICIENCY.

INTELLIGENT FINANCIAL STATEMENT FRAUD DETECTION SYSTEMS HAVE THEREFORE BEEN DEVELOPED TO SUPPORT DECISION-MAKING OF THE STAKEHOLDERS. FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN MANAGERIAL COMMENTS HAS BEEN NOTICED IN RECENT STUDIES. AS SUCH, THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE WHETHER AN IMPROVED FINANCIAL FRAUD DETECTION SYSTEM COULD BE DEVELOPED BY COMBINING SPECIFIC FEATURES DERIVED FROM FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND MANAGERIAL COMMENTS IN CORPORATE ANNUAL REPORTS. TO DEVELOP THIS SYSTEM, WE EMPLOYED BOTH INTELLIGENT FEATURE SELECTION AND CLASSIFICATION USING A WIDE RANGE OF MACHINE LEARNING METHODS. WE FOUND THAT ENSEMBLE METHODS OUTPERFORMED THE REMAINING METHODS IN TERMS OF TRUE POSITIVE RATE (FRAUDULENT FIRMS CORRECTLY CLASSIFIED AS FRAUDULENT). IN CONTRAST, BAYESIAN BELIEF NETWORKS (BBN) PERFORMED BEST ON NON-FRAUDULENT FIRMS (TRUE NEGATIVE RATE). THIS FINDING IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE INTERPRETABLE ``GREEN FLAG' VALUES (FOR WHICH FRAUD IS LIKELY ABSENT) COULD BE DERIVED, PROVIDING POTENTIAL DECISION SUPPORT TO AUDITORS DURING CLIENT SELECTION OR AUDIT PLANNING. WE ALSO OBSERVE THAT BOTH FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND TEXT IN ANNUAL REPORTS CAN BE UTILISED TO DETECT NON-FRAUDULENT FIRMS. HOWEVER, NON-ANNUAL REPORT DATA (ANALYSTS FORECASTS OF REVENUES AND EARNINGS) ARE NECESSARY TO DETECT FRAUDULENT FIRMS.

CONSIDERABLY LESS RESEARCH HAS FOCUSED ON THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN DEMENTIA SEVERITY AND LANGUAGE FEATURES. AIMS: THE CURRENT STUDY EXAMINES HOW SCORES ON A DEMENTIA SCREENING TEST (THE MINI-MENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION, MMSE) CORRELATE WITH FEATURES OF CONNECTED SPEECH. METHODS & PROCEDURES: THIRTY-FIVE INDIVIDUALS WITH AD (RANGE OF MMSE SCORES = 325) AND 35 COGNITIVELY INTACT PARTICIPANTS PROVIDED PICTURE DESCRIPTIONS. TEN LANGUAGE FEATURES WERE DERIVED FROM THEIR DESCRIPTIONS USING AN AUTOMATED TEXT ANALYSIS TOOL: TOTAL WORD NUMBER, PERCENTAGE OF CONTENT WORDS, PRONOUN RATIO, TYPE-TOKEN RATIO, MEAN WORD FREQUENCY, PERCENTAGE OF VERBS, PERCENTAGE OF VERBS IN THE MOST COMMON MORPHOLOGICAL FORM IN HEBREW, PERCENTAGE OF VERBS IN PRESENT TENSE, PERCENTAGE OF PREPOSITIONS, AND PERCENTAGE OF SUBORDINATION MARKERS. INFORMATION CONTENT WAS ALSO ANALYSED.OUTCOMES & RESULTS: GROUP DIFFERENCES EMERGED IN FIVE LANGUAGE FEATURES AS WELL AS IN INFORMATION CONTENT, ATTESTING FOR SUBSTANTIAL LEXICAL IMPAIRMENT IN AD. WITHIN THE AD GROUP, MMSE SCORES WERE CORRELATED WITH TYPE-TOKEN RATIO, WITH MEAN WORD FREQUENCY, AND WITH THE NUMBER OF INFORMATION UNITS. NO EQUIVALENT CORRELATIONS WERE FOUND WITHIN THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: DEMENTIA SEVERITY ASSOCIATES WITH DECREASING LEXICAL DIVERSITY, INCREASING WORD FREQUENCY, AND A REDUCTION IN RELEVANT INFORMATION CONTENT, BUT NOT WITH CHANGES IN GRAMMATICAL FEATURES OF LANGUAGE. A SIMPLE AUTOMATED ANALYSIS OF CONNECTED SPEECH COULD BE USED CLINICALLY TO DEFINE AND TRACK THE DECLINE IN LANGUAGE ABILITIES IN AD.

WORD2HTN FIRST LEARNS VECTOR REPRESENTATIONS THAT REPRESENT THE SEMANTICS AND SIMILARITIES OF THE ATOMS OCCURRING IN THE PLAN TRACES. THEN THE SYSTEM USES THOSE REPRESENTATIONS TO GROUP ATOMS OCCURRING IN THE TRACES INTO CLUSTERS. CLUSTERS ARE GROUPED TOGETHER INTO LARGER CLUSTERS BASED ON THEIR SIMILARITY. THESE GROUPINGS DEFINE A HIERARCHY OF ATOM CLUSTERS.

QDA MINER (HTTP:// WWW.PROVALISRESEARCH.COM/) IS ONE OF A SUITE DESIGNED BY PROVALIS RESEARCH FOR TEXTUAL AND IMAGE ANALYSIS. IN ITS OWN RIGHT QDA MINER IS A SOPHISTICATED PACKAGE FOR CONDUCTING ROBUST CODE-BASED ANALYSIS; WHEN INTEGRATED WITH WORDSTAT AND SIMSTAT, POSSIBILITIES FOR CONDUCTING MIXED ANALYSES OF MIXED DATA ARE GREATLY EXTENDED. PROVALIS RESEARCHS TOOLS IN MOST RESPECTS EQUAL OTHERS IN SUPPORTING CODE-BASED QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS BUT OUTSTRIP THOSE FOR QUANTITATIVE, MIXED, AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. THIS REVIEW HIGHLIGHTS QDA MINERS DISTINGUISHING FEATURES AND SUMMARIZES FUNCTIONS OF ITS CONCURRENT USE WITH WORDSTAT AND SIMSTAT THAT MAKE IT A PARTICULARLY GOOD CHOICE FOR MIXED METHODS ANALYSIS. INHERENT TO QDA MINERS DEVELOPMENTAL PHILOSOPHY IS THE FACILITATION OF ANALYSIS FROM DIFFERENT EPISTEMOLOGICAL STANDPOINTS AND THE PROVISION OF TOOLS THAT VISUALIZE CODING PATTERNS AND TRENDS, EXPLORE RELATIONSHIPS IN CODING APPLICATIONS, AND TEST HYPOTHESES WITHOUT THE NEED TO EXPORT TO A SEPARATE STATISTICAL PROGRAM. SHARING THE ARCHITECTURAL FORMAT OF WORDSTAT (TEXT MINING) AND SIMSTAT (STATISTICAL ANALYSIS), LARGE MIXED CORPORA CAN BE STORED WITHIN ONE FILE.

MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE STUDY AIMS TO SHOW HOW BRAND ASSOCIATIONS CAN BE IDENTIFIED AND ANALYSED IN AN ONLINE COMMUNITY OF INTERNATIONAL CONSUMERS OF FASHION TO DETERMINE THE DEGREE OF MATCHING WITH COMPANY-DEFINED BRAND ASSOCIATIONS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE METHODOLOGY IS TWO-PRONGED, INTEGRATING QUALITATIVE MARKET RESEARCH TECHNIQUES WITH QUANTITATIVE TEXT MINING. IT WAS APPLIED TO DETERMINE TYPES AND PERCEPTIONS OF BRAND ASSOCIATIONS AMONG FASHION BLOGGERS WITH REFERENCE TO THREE LEADING ITALIAN FASHION HOUSES. THESE WERE THEN COMPARED TO BRAND ASSOCIATIONS FOUND IN COMPANY-GENERATED TEXTS TO MEASURE THE DEGREE OF MATCHING. FINDINGS - THE RESULTS SHOWED CONSISTENT BRAND ASSOCIATIONS ACROSS THE THREE BRANDS, AS WELL AS SUBSTANTIAL MATCHING WITH COMPANY-DEFINED BRAND ASSOCIATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE ANALYSIS REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF DISTINCTIVE BRAND ASSOCIATION THEMES THAT SHED FURTHER LIGHT ON HOW BRAND ATTRIBUTES WERE PERCEIVED BY BLOG PARTICIPANTS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THE METHODS DESCRIBED CAN BE USED BY MANAGERS TO IDENTIFY AND REINFORCE FAVOURABLE BRAND ASSOCIATIONS AMONG CONSUMERS. THIS KNOWLEDGE CAN THEN BE APPLIED TOWARDS DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING EFFECTIVE BRAND STRATEGIES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE AUTHORS PROPOSE AN INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH TO INVESTIGATE BRAND ASSOCIATIONS IN ONLINE COMMUNITIES. IT INCORPORATES TEXT MINING AND COMPUTER-ASSISTED TEXTUAL ANALYSIS AS TECHNIQUES BORROWED FROM THE FIELD OF LINGUISTICS WHICH HAVE THUS FAR SEEN LITTLE APPLICATION IN MARKETING STUDIES, BUT CAN NONETHELESS PROVIDE IMPORTANT INSIGHTS FOR STRATEGIC BRAND MANAGEMENT.

THREE WEEKS LATER, A SHORT HANDS-ON INSTRUCTION OF THE CORPUS QUERY TOOL WAS GIVEN, FOLLOWED BY REVISION ACTIVITIES IN WHICH THE PARTICIPANTS WERE INSTRUCTED TO REVISE THEIR FIRST DRAFTS, WITH OR WITHOUT THE TOOL DEPENDING ON THE CODES GIVEN TO EACH ERROR. 188 ERRORS WERE AUTOMATICALLY CLASSIFIED INTO THREE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES (OMISSION, ADDITION AND MISFORMATION) USING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES. ALL WORDS AND PHRASES TAGGED FOR ERRORS WERE FURTHER ANNOTATED FOR PART-OF-SPEECH (POS) INFORMATION. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE ACCURACY RATE AMONG THE THREE ERROR TYPES WHEN THE STUDENTS CONSULTED THE CORPUS: OMISSION AND ADDITION ERRORS WERE EASILY IDENTIFIED AND CORRECTED, WHEREAS MISFORMATION ERRORS WERE LOW IN CORRECTION ACCURACY. THIS REVEALS THAT CERTAIN ERRORS ARE MORE SUITABLE FOR CHECKING AGAINST CORPUS DATA THAN OTHERS. (PSYCINFO DATABASE RECORD (C) 2016 APA, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED)",0,0,1

INSPIRED BY PREVIOUS WORK ON CROWDSOURCING, WE INVESTIGATE THE VIABILITY OF USING NON-EXPERT LABELS INSTEAD OF GOLD STANDARD ANNOTATIONS FROM EXPERTS FOR A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH TO AUTOMATIC READABILITY PREDICTION. IN ORDER TO DO SO, WE EVALUATE TWO DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES TO ASSESS THE READABILITY OF A WIDE VARIETY OF TEXT MATERIAL: A MORE TRADITIONAL SETUP IN WHICH EXPERT READERS MAKE READABILITY JUDGMENTS AND A CROWDSOURCING SETUP FOR USERS WHO ARE NOT NECESSARILY EXPERTS. TO THIS PURPOSE TWO ASSESSMENT TOOLS WERE IMPLEMENTED: A TOOL WHERE EXPERT READERS CAN RANK A BATCH OF TEXTS BASED ON READABILITY, AND A LIGHTWEIGHT CROWDSOURCING TOOL, WHICH INVITES USERS TO PROVIDE PAIRWISE COMPARISONS. TO VALIDATE THIS APPROACH, READABILITY ASSESSMENTS FOR A CORPUS OF WRITTEN DUTCH GENERIC TEXTS WERE GATHERED. BY COLLECTING MULTIPLE ASSESSMENTS PER TEXT, WE EXPLICITLY WANTED TO LEVEL OUT READERS' BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE AND ATTITUDE. OUR FINDINGS SHOW THAT THE ASSESSMENTS COLLECTED THROUGH BOTH METHODOLOGIES ARE HIGHLY CONSISTENT AND THAT CROWDSOURCING IS A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE TO EXPERT LABELING. THIS IS A GOOD NEWS AS CROWDSOURCING IS MORE LIGHTWEIGHT TO USE AND CAN HAVE ACCESS TO A MUCH WIDER AUDIENCE OF POTENTIAL ANNOTATORS. BY PERFORMING A SET OF BASIC MACHINE LEARNING EXPERIMENTS USING A FEATURE SET THAT MAINLY ENCODES BASIC LEXICAL AND MORPHO-SYNTACTIC INFORMATION, WE FURTHER ILLUSTRATE HOW THE COLLECTED DATA CAN BE USED TO PERFORM TEXT COMPARISONS OR TO ASSIGN AN ABSOLUTE READABILITY SCORE TO AN INDIVIDUAL TEXT. WE DO NOT FOCUS ON OPTIMISING THE ALGORITHMS TO ACHIEVE THE BEST POSSIBLE RESULTS FOR THE LEARNING TASKS, BUT CARRY THEM OUT TO ILLUSTRATE THE VARIOUS POSSIBILITIES OF OUR DATA SETS. THE RESULTS ON DIFFERENT DATA SETS, HOWEVER, SHOW THAT OUR SYSTEM OUTPERFORMS THE READABILITY FORMULAS AND A BASELINE LANGUAGE MODELLING APPROACH.

KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE OF A DOMAIN EXPERT IS ESSENTIAL FOR CONTENT MANAGEMENT IN THE HEALTH DOMAIN. THE RATE OF GENERATION OF ONLINE HEALTH RESOURCES IS EXPONENTIAL AND THEREBY MANUAL EXAMINATION FOR RELEVANCE TO A SPECIFIC TOPIC AND AUDIENCE IS A FORMIDABLE CHALLENGE FOR DOMAIN EXPERTS. INTELLIGENT CONTENT DISCOVERY FOR EFFECTIVE CONTENT MANAGEMENT IS A LESS RESEARCHED TOPIC. AN EXISTING EXPERT-ENDORSED CONTENT REPOSITORY CAN PROVIDE THE NECESSARY LEVERAGE TO AUTOMATICALLY IDENTIFY RELEVANT RESOURCES AND EVALUATE QUALITATIVE METRICS. OBJECTIVE: THIS PAPER REPORTS ON THE DESIGN RESEARCH TOWARDS AN INTELLIGENT TECHNIQUE FOR AUTOMATED CONTENT DISCOVERY AND RANKING FOR HEALTH INFORMATION PORTALS. THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUE AIMS TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY OF THE CURRENT MOSTLY MANUAL PROCESS OF PORTAL CONTENT MANAGEMENT BY UTILISING AN EXISTING EXPERT-ENDORSED CONTENT REPOSITORY AS A SUPPORTING BASE AND A BENCHMARK TO EVALUATE THE SUITABILITY OF NEW CONTENT METHODS: A MODEL FOR CONTENT MANAGEMENT WAS ESTABLISHED BASED ON A FIELD STUDY OF POTENTIAL USERS. THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUE IS INTEGRAL TO THIS CONTENT MANAGEMENT MODEL AND EXECUTES IN SEVERAL PHASES (IE, QUERY CONSTRUCTION, CONTENT SEARCH, TEXT ANALYTICS AND FUZZY MULTI-CRITERIA RANKING). THE CONSTRUCTION OF MULTI-DIMENSIONAL SEARCH QUERIES WITH INPUT FROM WORDNET, THE USE OF MULTI-WORD AND SINGLE-WORD TERMS AS REPRESENTATIVE SEMANTICS FOR TEXT ANALYTICS AND THE USE OF FUZZY MULTI-CRITERIA RANKING FOR SUBJECTIVE EVALUATION OF QUALITY METRICS ARE ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTIONS REPORTED IN THIS PAPER. RESULTS: THE FEASIBILITY OF THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUE WAS EXAMINED WITH EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED ON AN ACTUAL HEALTH INFORMATION PORTAL, THE BCKONLINE PORTAL. BOTH INTERMEDIARY AND FINAL RESULTS GENERATED BY THE TECHNIQUE ARE PRESENTED IN THE PAPER AND THESE HELP TO ESTABLISH BENEFITS OF THE TECHNIQUE AND ITS CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS EFFECTIVE CONTENT MANAGEMENT. CONCLUSIONS: THE PREVALENCE OF LARGE NUMBERS OF ONLINE HEALTH RESOURCES IS A KEY OBSTACLE FOR DOMAIN EXPERTS INVOLVED IN CONTENT MANAGEMENT OF HEALTH INFORMATION PORTALS AND WEBSITES. THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUE HAS PROVEN SUCCESSFUL AT SEARCH AND IDENTIFICATION OF RESOURCES AND THE MEASUREMENT OF THEIR RELEVANCE.

"1826","CHO H, 2014, ","IN LEXICON-BASED SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION, THE PROBLEM OF CONTEXTUAL POLARITY MUST BE EXPLICITLY HANDLED SINCE IT IS A MAJOR CAUSE FOR CLASSIFICATION ERROR. ONE WAY TO HANDLE CONTEXTUAL POLARITY IS TO REVISE THE PRIOR POLARITY OF THE SENTIMENT DICTIONARY TO FIT THE DOMAIN. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A DATA-DRIVEN METHOD OF ADAPTING SENTIMENT DICTIONARIES TO DIVERSE DOMAINS. OUR METHOD FIRST MERGES MULTIPLE SENTIMENT DICTIONARIES AT THE ENTRY WORD LEVEL TO EXPAND THE DICTIONARY. THEN, LEVERAGING THE RATIO OF THE POSITIVE/NEGATIVE TRAINING DATA, IT SELECTIVELY REMOVES THE ENTRY WORDS THAT DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE CLASSIFICATION. FINALLY, IT SELECTIVELY SWITCHES THE SENTIMENT POLARITY OF THE ENTRY WORDS TO ADAPT TO THE DOMAIN. IN ESSENCE, OUR METHOD COMPARES THE POSITIVE/NEGATIVE REVIEWS DICTIONARY WORD OCCURRENCE RATIOS WITH THE POSITIVE/NEGATIVE REVIEW RATIO ITSELF TO DETERMINE WHICH ENTRY WORDS TO BE REMOVED AND WHICH ENTRY WORDS SENTIMENT POLARITY TO BE SWITCHED.

LARGE QUANTITIES OF HIGH QUALITY TRAINING DATA ARE ALMOST ALWAYS A PREREQUISITE FOR EMPLOYING SUPERVISED MACHINE-LEARNING TECHNIQUES TO ACHIEVE HIGH CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE. HOWEVER, THE HUMAN LABOUR NEEDED TO PRODUCE AND MAINTAIN SUCH RESOURCES IS A SIGNIFICANT LIMITATION. IN THIS STUDY, WE IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF DRUG NER WITHOUT RELYING EXCLUSIVELY ON MANUAL ANNOTATIONS. METHODS: WE PERFORM DRUG NER USING EITHER A SMALL GOLD-STANDARD CORPUS (120 ABSTRACTS) OR NO CORPUS AT ALL. IN OUR APPROACH, WE DEVELOP A VOTING SYSTEM TO COMBINE A NUMBER OF HETEROGENEOUS MODELS, BASED ON DICTIONARY KNOWLEDGE, GOLD-STANDARD CORPORA AND SILVER ANNOTATIONS, TO ENHANCE PERFORMANCE. TO IMPROVE RECALL, WE EMPLOYED GENETIC PROGRAMMING TO EVOLVE 11 REGULAR-EXPRESSION PATTERNS THAT CAPTURE COMMON DRUG SUFFIXES AND USED THEM AS AN EXTRA MEANS FOR RECOGNITION. MATERIALS: OUR APPROACH USES A DICTIONARY OF DRUG NAMES, I.E. DRUGBANK, A SMALL MANUALLY ANNOTATED CORPUS, I.E. THE PHARMACOKINETIC CORPUS, AND A PART OF THE UKPMC DATABASE, AS RAW BIOMEDICAL TEXT. GOLD-STANDARD AND SILVER ANNOTATED DATA ARE USED TO TRAIN MAXIMUM ENTROPY AND MULTINOMIAL LOGISTIC REGRESSION CLASSIFIERS. RESULTS: AGGREGATING DRUG NER METHODS, BASED ON GOLD-STANDARD ANNOTATIONS, DICTIONARY KNOWLEDGE AND PATTERNS, IMPROVED THE PERFORMANCE ON MODELS TRAINED ON GOLD-STANDARD ANNOTATIONS, ONLY, ACHIEVING A MAXIMUM F-SCORE OF 95%. IN ADDITION, COMBINING MODELS TRAINED ON SILVER ANNOTATIONS, DICTIONARY KNOWLEDGE AND PATTERNS ARE SHOWN TO ACHIEVE COMPARABLE PERFORMANCE TO MODELS TRAINED EXCLUSIVELY ON GOLD-STANDARD DATA. THE MAIN REASON APPEARS TO BE THE MORPHOLOGICAL SIMILARITIES SHARED AMONG DRUG NAMES. CONCLUSION: WE CONCLUDE THAT GOLD-STANDARD DATA ARE NOT A HARD REQUIREMENT FOR DRUG NER. COMBINING HETEROGENEOUS MODELS BUILD ON DICTIONARY KNOWLEDGE CAN ACHIEVE SIMILAR OR COMPARABLE CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE WITH THAT OF THE BEST PERFORMING MODEL TRAINED ON GOLD-STANDARD ANNOTATIONS.

THIS IS A NECESSARY AND COMPLEX TASK INVOLVING CODERS ADHERING TO CODING GUIDELINES AND CODING ALL ASSIGNABLE CODES. WITH THE POPULARITY OF ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS (EMRS), COMPUTATIONAL APPROACHES TO CODE ASSIGNMENT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED IN THE RECENT YEARS. HOWEVER, MOST EFFORTS HAVE FOCUSED ON SINGLE AND OFTEN SHORT CLINICAL NARRATIVES, WHILE REALISTIC SCENARIOS WARRANT FULL EMR LEVEL ANALYSIS FOR CODE ASSIGNMENT. OBJECTIVE: WE EVALUATE SUPERVISED LEARNING APPROACHES TO AUTOMATICALLY ASSIGN INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES (NINTH REVISION)CLINICAL MODIFICATION (ICD-9-CM) CODES TO EMRS BY EXPERIMENTING WITH A LARGE REALISTIC EMR DATASET. THE OVERALL GOAL IS TO IDENTIFY METHODS THAT OFFER SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE IN THIS TASK WHEN CONSIDERING SUCH DATASETS. METHODS: WE USE A DATASET OF 71,463 EMRS CORRESPONDING TO IN-PATIENT VISITS WITH DISCHARGE DATE FALLING IN A TWO YEAR PERIOD (20112012) FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY (UKY) MEDICAL CENTER. WE CURATE A SMALLER SUBSET OF THIS DATASET AND ALSO USE A THIRD GOLD STANDARD DATASET OF RADIOLOGY REPORTS. WE CONDUCT EXPERIMENTS USING DIFFERENT PROBLEM TRANSFORMATION APPROACHES WITH FEATURE AND DATA SELECTION COMPONENTS AND EMPLOYING SUITABLE LABEL CALIBRATION AND RANKING METHODS WITH NOVEL FEATURES INVOLVING CODE CO-OCCURRENCE FREQUENCIES AND LATENT CODE ASSOCIATIONS. RESULTS: OVER ALL CODES WITH AT LEAST 50 TRAINING EXAMPLES WE OBTAIN A MICRO F-SCORE OF 0.48. ON THE SET OF CODES THAT OCCUR AT LEAST IN 1% OF THE TWO YEAR DATASET, WE ACHIEVE A MICRO F-SCORE OF 0.54. FOR THE SMALLER RADIOLOGY REPORT DATASET, THE CLASSIFIER CHAINING APPROACH YIELDS BEST RESULTS. FOR THE SMALLER SUBSET OF THE UKY DATASET, FEATURE SELECTION, DATA SELECTION, AND LABEL CALIBRATION OFFER BEST PERFORMANCE. CONCLUSIONS: WE SHOW THAT DATASETS AT DIFFERENT SCALE (SIZE OF THE EMRS, NUMBER OF DISTINCT CODES) AND WITH DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS WARRANT DIFFERENT LEARNING APPROACHES. FOR SHORTER NARRATIVES PERTAINING TO A PARTICULAR MEDICAL SUBDOMAIN (E.G., RADIOLOGY, PATHOLOGY), CLASSIFIER CHAINING IS IDEAL GIVEN THE CODES ARE HIGHLY RELATED WITH EACH OTHER. FOR REALISTIC IN-PATIENT FULL EMRS, FEATURE AND DATA SELECTION METHODS OFFER HIGH PERFORMANCE FOR SMALLER DATASETS. HOWEVER, FOR LARGE EMR DATASETS, WE OBSERVE THAT THE BINARY RELEVANCE APPROACH WITH LEARNING-TO-RANK BASED CODE RERANKING OFFERS THE BEST PERFORMANCE. REGARDLESS OF THE TRAINING DATASET SIZE, FOR GENERAL EMRS, LABEL CALIBRATION TO SELECT THE OPTIMAL NUMBER OF LABELS IS AN INDISPENSABLE FINAL STEP.

IN THIS ARTICLE, WE STUDY THE PROBLEM OF FINDING PREVIOUS QUERIES (E.G., POSED BY OTHER USERS) WHICH MAY BE SIMILAR TO NEW QUERIES, AND ADAPTING THEIR ANSWERS AS THE ANSWERS TO THE NEW QUERIES. A KEY CHALLENGE HERE IS TO THE BRIDGE THE LEXICAL GAP BETWEEN NEW QUERIES AND OLD ANSWERS. FOR EXAMPLE, 'COMPANY' IN THE QUERIES MAY CORRESPOND TO 'FIRM' IN THE ANSWERS. TO ADDRESS THIS CHALLENGE, PAST RESEARCH HAS PROPOSED TECHNIQUES SIMILAR TO MACHINE TRANSLATION THAT 'TRANSLATE' OLD ANSWERS TO ONES USING THE WORDS IN THE NEW QUERIES. HOWEVER, A KEY LIMITATION OF THESE WORKS IS THAT THEY ASSUME QUERIES AND ANSWERS ARE PARALLEL TEXTS, WHICH IS HARDLY TRUE IN REALITY. AS A RESULT, THE TRANSLATED OR REPHRASED ANSWERS MAY NOT LOOK INTUITIVE. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE PROPOSE A NOVEL APPROACH TO LEARN THE SEMANTIC REPRESENTATION OF QUERIES AND ANSWERS BY USING A NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURE.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK IS TO SUGGEST AN APPROACH AND A USER INTERFACE FOR BCI SPELLING APPLICATIONS COMBINING STATE-OF-THE-ART BCI AND NLP TECHNIQUES TO MAXIMIZE THE OVERALL COMMUNICATION RATE OF THE SYSTEM. THE BCI PARADIGM ADOPTED IS MOTOR IMAGERY, THAT IS, WHEN THE SUBJECT IMAGINES MOVING A CERTAIN PART OF THE BODY, HE/SHE PRODUCES MODIFICATIONS TO SPECIFIC BRAIN RHYTHMS THAT ARE DETECTED IN REAL-TIME THROUGH AN ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM AND TRANSLATED INTO COMMANDS FOR A SPELLING APPLICATION.

(THE FOLLOWING ABSTRACT OF THE ORIGINAL ARTICLE APPEARED IN RECORD [RID]2016-02328-001[/RID].) A COMMONLY HELD BELIEF AMONG EDUCATORS, RESEARCHERS, AND STUDENTS IS THAT HIGH-QUALITY TEXTS ARE EASIER TO READ THAN LOW-QUALITY TEXTS, AS THEY CONTAIN MORE ENGAGING NARRATIVE AND STORY-LIKE ELEMENTS. INTERESTINGLY, THESE ASSUMPTIONS HAVE TYPICALLY FAILED TO BE SUPPORTED BY THE LITERATURE ON WRITING. PREVIOUS RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT HIGHER QUALITY WRITING IS TYPICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASED LEVELS OF TEXT NARRATIVITY AND READABILITY. IN THIS STUDY, THE AUTHORS PRESENT THE HYPOTHESIS THAT WRITING PROFICIENCY IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INDIVIDUALS FLEXIBLE USE OF LINGUISTIC PROPERTIES, RATHER THAN SIMPLY THE CONSISTENT USE OF A PARTICULAR SET OF LINGUISTIC PROPERTIES. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, THE AUTHORS LEVERAGED BOTH NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING AND DYNAMIC METHODOLOGIES TO CAPTURE VARIABILITY IN STUDENTS USE OF NARRATIVE STYLE ACROSS MULTIPLE ESSAY PROMPTS. FORTY-FIVE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WROTE 16 ESSAYS ACROSS 8 LABORATORY SESSIONS. NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES WERE FIRST USED TO CALCULATE THE NARRATIVITY OF EACH ESSAY. RANDOM WALK AND EUCLIDIAN DISTANCE MEASURES WERE THEN USED TO VISUALIZE AND CLASSIFY STUDENTS FLEXIBILITY IN NARRATIVITY ACROSS ESSAYS. THE RESULTS SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESES THAT STUDENTS WHO WERE FLEXIBLE IN THEIR USE OF NARRATIVITY ALSO WROTE ESSAYS THAT WERE RATED AS HAVING HIGHER QUALITY, WHEREAS INFLEXIBLE WRITERS TENDED TO WRITE LOWER QUALITY ESSAYS. ADDITIONALLY, MORE FLEXIBLE WRITERS PERFORMED HIGHER THAN THE MORE INFLEXIBLE WRITERS ON GENERAL ASSESSMENTS OF LITERACY AND PRIOR KNOWLEDGE. THESE RESULTS ARE IMPORTANT FOR RESEARCHERS AND EDUCATORS, AS THEY INDICATE THAT THE LINK BETWEEN TEXTUAL PROPERTIES AND WRITING QUALITY MAY FLUCTUATE ACCORDING TO THE CONTEXT OF A GIVEN WRITING ASSIGNMENT.

USING SEMANTIC NETWORKS, WE DEVELOPED DIALOGUE LINES FOR REFLECTION-PROMPTING AGENTS. WE ANALYZED THE PARTICIPANTS ANSWERS USING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY TO CLASSIFY THE SENTENCES INTO POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE RANKINGS. A PRELIMINARY FIELD STUDY WITH 117 HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WAS CONDUCTED OVER THREE WEEKS TO TEST THE EFFECTS OF AGENT-PROMPTED SELF-REFLECTION. THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATED THAT 96% AND 62% OF PARTICIPANTS SEPARATELY COMPLETED THE FIRST AND THE SECOND SIMULATION ACTIVITIES (INCLUDING THE AGENT-PROMPTED SELF-REFLECTIONS RESPECTIVELY).

TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM, WE DEVELOP A SEMI-SUPERVISED SYSTEM CALLED ONLINE REVIEW QUALITY MINING (ORQM). EMBEDDED WITH INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS AND SEMI-SUPERVISED ENSEMBLE LEARNING, ORQM EXPLOITS TWO OPPORTUNITIES: THE IMPROVEMENT OF CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE THROUGH THE USE OF A FEW LABELED INSTANCES AND NUMEROUS UNLABELED INSTANCES, AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF E-COMMERCE COMMUNITIES AS IDENTIFIERS OF INFLUENTIAL REVIEWERS WHO WRITE HIGH-QUALITY REVIEWS.

METHOD: TWENTY-ONE CLINICIANS WERE PRESENTED WITH INFORMATION ABOUT TWO CANCER PATIENTS AND ASKED TO ANSWER KEY QUESTIONS. FOR EACH CLINICIAN, THE INFORMATION ON ONE OF THE PATIENTS COMPRISED THEIR OFFICIAL HOSPITAL RECORDS, AND FOR THE OTHER PATIENT IT COMPRISED SUMMARIES THAT WERE COMPUTER-GENERATED BY A NATURAL LANGUAGE GENERATION SYSTEM FROM DATA EXTRACTED FROM THE OFFICIAL RECORDS. WE MEASURED THE ACCURACY OF THE CLINICIANS RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONS, THE TIME THEY TOOK TO COMPLETE THEM, AND RECORDED THEIR ATTITUDE TO THE COMPUTER-GENERATED SUMMARIES. RESULTS: RESULTS SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE ACCURACY OF RESPONSES TO THE COMPUTER-GENERATED RECORDS OVER THE OFFICIAL RECORDS, BUT A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE TIME TAKEN TO ASSESS THE PATIENTS CONDITION FROM THE COMPUTER-GENERATED RECORDS. CLINICIANS EXPRESSED A POSITIVE ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE COMPUTER-GENERATED RECORDS.

FOR FACE RECOGNITION AND HUMAN MACHINE INTERACTION, RANDOM TREES AND WELL-KNOWN METHODS FROM NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING ARE DEPLOYED. FOR DELIBERATION, WE USE THE ROBOT PROGRAMMING AND PLAN LANGUAGE READYLOG, WHICH WAS DEVELOPED FOR THE HIGH-LEVEL CONTROL OF AGENTS AND ROBOTS; IT ALLOWS COMBINING PROGRAMMING THE BEHAVIOUR USING PLANNING TO FIND A COURSE OF ACTION. READYLOG IS A VARIANT OF THE ROBOT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE GOLOG. WE EXTENDED READYLOG TO BE ABLE TO COPE WITH QUALITATIVE NOTIONS OF SPACE FREQUENTLY USED BY HUMANS, SUCH AS 'NEAR' AND 'FAR'. THIS FACILITATES HUMANROBOT INTERACTION BY BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN HUMAN NATURAL LANGUAGE AND THE NUMERICAL VALUES NEEDED BY THE ROBOT. FURTHER, WE USE READYLOG TO INCREASE THE FLEXIBLE INTERPRETATION OF HUMAN COMMANDS WITH DECISION-THEORETIC PLANNING. WE GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF THE DIFFERENT METHODS DEPLOYED IN CAESAR AND SHOW THE APPLICABILITY OF A SYSTEM EQUIPPED WITH THESE AI TECHNIQUES IN DOMESTIC SERVICE ROBOTICS.

EXISTING METHODS EITHER IGNORE THESE THREE PROBLEMS OR REDUCE ONE WITH THE PRICE OF AGGRAVATING ANOTHER. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A 0,1 LABEL MATRIX COMPRESSION AND RECOVERY METHOD TERMED 'COMPRESSED LABELING (CL)' TO SIMULTANEOUSLY SOLVE OR AT LEAST REDUCE THESE THREE PROBLEMS. CL FIRST COMPRESSES THE ORIGINAL LABEL MATRIX TO IMPROVE BALANCE AND INDEPENDENCE BY PRESERVING THE SIGNS OF ITS GAUSSIAN RANDOM PROJECTIONS. AFTERWARD, WE DIRECTLY UTILIZE POPULAR BINARY CLASSIFICATION METHODS (E.G., SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES) FOR EACH NEW LABEL. A FAST RECOVERY ALGORITHM IS DEVELOPED TO RECOVER THE ORIGINAL LABELS FROM THE PREDICTED NEW LABELS. IN THE RECOVERY ALGORITHM, A 'LABELSET DISTILLING METHOD' IS DESIGNED TO EXTRACT DISTILLED LABELSETS (DLS), I.E., THE FREQUENTLY APPEARED LABEL SUBSETS FROM THE ORIGINAL LABELS VIA RECURSIVE CLUSTERING AND SUBTRACTION. GIVEN A DISTILLED AND AN ORIGINAL LABEL VECTOR, WE DISCOVER THAT THE SIGNS OF THEIR RANDOM PROJECTIONS HAVE AN EXPLICIT JOINT DISTRIBUTION THAT CAN BE QUICKLY COMPUTED FROM A GEOMETRIC INFERENCE. BASED ON THIS OBSERVATION, THE ORIGINAL LABEL VECTOR IS EXACTLY DETERMINED AFTER PERFORMING A SERIES OF KULLBACK-LEIBLER DIVERGENCE BASED HYPOTHESIS TESTS ON THE DISTRIBUTION ABOUT THE NEW LABELS. CL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES THE BALANCE OF THE TRAINING SAMPLES AND REDUCES THE DEPENDENCE BETWEEN DIFFERENT LABELS. MOREOVER, IT ACCELERATES THE LEARNING PROCESS BY TRAINING FEWER BINARY CLASSIFIERS FOR COMPRESSED LABELS, AND MAKES USE OF LABEL DEPENDENCE VIA DLS BASED TESTS. THEORETICALLY, WE PROVE THE RECOVERY BOUNDS OF CL WHICH VERIFIES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CL FOR LABEL COMPRESSION AND MULTI-LABEL CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT BROUGHT BY LABEL CORRELATIONS PRESERVED IN DLS. WE SHOW THE EFFECTIVENESS, EFFICIENCY AND ROBUSTNESS OF CL VIA 5 GROUPS OF EXPERIMENTS ON 21 DATASETS FROM TEXT CLASSIFICATION, IMAGE ANNOTATION, SCENE CLASSIFICATION, MUSIC CATEGORIZATION, GENOMICS AND WEB PAGE CLASSIFICATION.

REAL-WORLD NLP SYSTEMS NEED LARGE-SCALE LEXICA, WHICH PROVIDE RICH INFORMATION ABOUT WORDS AND WORD SENSES AT ALL LEVELS: MORPHOLOGIC, SYNTACTIC, LEXICAL SEMANTICS, ETC., BUT THE CONSTRUCTION OF LEXICAL RESOURCES IS A DIFFICULT AND COSTLY TASK. THE LAST DECADE HAS BEEN HIGHLY INFLUENCED BY THE NOTION OF REUSABILITY, THAT IS, THE USE OF THE INFORMATION OF EXISTING LEXICAL RESOURCES IN CONSTRUCTING NEW ONES. IT IS UNREALISTIC, HOWEVER, TO EXPECT THAT THE GREAT VARIETY OF AVAILABLE LEXICAL INFORMATION RESOURCES COULD BE CONVERTED INTO A SINGLE AND STANDARD REPRESENTATION SCHEMA IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO PRESENT THE ELHISA SYSTEM, A SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE FOR THE INTEGRATION OF HETEROGENEOUS LEXICAL INFORMATION. WE ADDRESS, FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE INFORMATION INTEGRATION AREA, THE PROBLEM OF QUERYING VERY DIFFERENT EXISTING LEXICAL INFORMATION SOURCES USING A UNIQUE AND COMMON QUERY LANGUAGE. THE INTEGRATION IN ELHISA IS PERFORMED IN A LOGICAL WAY, SO THAT THE LEXICAL RESOURCES DO NOT SUFFER ANY MODIFICATION WHEN INTEGRATING THEM INTO THE SYSTEM. ELHISA IS PRIMARILY DEFINED AS A CONSULTATION SYSTEM FOR ACCESSING STRUCTURED LEXICAL INFORMATION, AND THEREFORE IT DOES NOT HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO MODIFY OR UPDATE THE UNDERLYING INFORMATION. FOR THIS PURPOSE, A GENERAL CONCEPTUAL MODEL (GCM) FOR DESCRIBING DIVERSE LEXICAL DATA HAS BEEN CONCEIVED. THE GCM ESTABLISHES A FIXED VOCABULARY DESCRIBING OBJECTS IN THE LEXICAL INFORMATION DOMAIN, THEIR ATTRIBUTES, AND THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THEM. TO INTEGRATE THE LEXICAL RESOURCES INTO THE FEDERATION, A SOURCE CONCEPTUAL MODEL (SCM) IS BUILT ON THE TOP OF EACH ONE, WHICH REPRESENTS THE LEXICAL OBJECTS CONCURRING IN EACH PARTICULAR SOURCE. TO ANSWER THE USER QUERIES, ELHISA MUST ACCESS THE INTEGRATED RESOURCES, AND, HENCE, IT MUST TRANSLATE THE QUERY EXPRESSED IN GCM TERMS INTO QUERIES FORMULATED IN TERMS OF THE SCM OF EACH SOURCE. THE RELATION BETWEEN THE GCM AND THE SCMS IS EXPLICITLY DESCRIBED BY MEANS OF MAPPING RULES CALLED CONTENT DESCRIPTION RULES. DATA INTEGRATION AT THE EXTENSIONAL LEVEL IS ACHIEVED BY MEANS OF THE DATA CLEANSING PROCESS, NEEDED IF WE WANT TO COMPARE THE DATA ARRIVING FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES.

DESIGN: WE ANALYZED 125 MEDICAL RECORDS OF KNOWN SMOKERS AT EACH OF FOUR HMOS IN 2003 AND 2004. ONE TRAINED ABSTRACTOR AT EACH HMO MANUALLY CODED ALL 500 RECORDS ACCORDING TO WHETHER OR NOT EACH OF THE 5A'S OF SMOKING CESSATION CARE WAS ADDRESSED DURING ROUTINE OUTPATIENT VISITS. MEASUREMENTS: FOR EACH PATIENT'S RECORD, WE COMPARED THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF EACH OF THE 5A'S AS ASSESSED BY EACH HUMAN CODER AND BY MEDICLASS. WE MEASURED THE CHANCE-CORRECTED AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE HUMAN RATERS AND MEDICLASS USING THE KAPPA STATISTIC. RESULTS: FOR 'ASK' AND 'ASSIST,' AGREEMENT AMONG HUMAN CODERS WAS INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM AGREEMENT BETWEEN HUMANS AND MEDICLASS (P>0.05).

HOWEVER, UNSTRUCTURED KNOWLEDGE IS INCONVENIENT AND DIFFICULT FOR SHARING, ORGANIZING AND ACQUISITION. THIS PAPER SEEKS TO PRESENT THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A MULTI-FACET TAXONOMY SYSTEM (MTS) FOR EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF UNSTRUCTURED KNOWLEDGE. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: MULTI-FACET TAXONOMY IS A MULTI-DIMENSIONAL TAXONOMY WHICH ALLOWS THE CLASSIFICATION OF KNOWLEDGE ASSETS UNDER MULTIPLE CONCEPTS AT ANY LEVELS OF ABSTRACTION. THE MTS SYSTEM IS BASED ON FIVE COMPONENTS: MULTI-DIMENSIONAL TAXONOMY STRUCTURE, THESAURUS MODEL, AUTOMATIC CLASSIFICATION MECHANISM, INTELLIGENT SEARCHING, AND SELF-MAINTENANCE OF TAXONOMY, RESPECTIVELY. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) AND NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESS (NLP) TECHNOLOGIES ARE USED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MTS. FINDINGS: WITH THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF THE MTS, THE ACCURACY OF CATEGORIZATION OF UNSTRUCTURED KNOWLEDGE IS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED. IT ALSO ALLOWS AN ORGANIZATION TO CAPTURE THE VALUABLE TACIT KNOWLEDGE EMBEDDED IN THE UNSTRUCTURED KNOWLEDGE ASSETS. THIS HELPS AN ORGANIZATION TO EXPLORE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONTINUOUS BUSINESS IMPROVEMENT. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MTS SYSTEM NOT ONLY DRAMATICALLY REDUCES THE HUMAN EFFORT, TIME AND COST FOR UKM BUT ALSO ALLOWS AN ORGANIZATION TO CAPTURE VALUABLE KNOWLEDGE EMBEDDED IN UNSTRUCTURED KNOWLEDGE ASSETS.

TO OVERCOME THE DROP IN ACCURACY WHEN PREDICTING INSTANCES OF THE RARE CLASS DUE TO THIS DISPROPORTION, WE BALANCE THE LEARNING DATA BY APPLYING ONE-SIDED SAMPLING TO THE TRAINING CORPUS AND THUS BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF NON-COMPLEMENT INSTANCES. THIS APPROACH HAS BEEN USED IN THE PAST IN SEVERAL DOMAINS (IMAGE PROCESSING, MEDICINE, ETC) BUT NOT IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING. FOR IDENTIFYING THE EXAMPLES THAT ARE SAFE TO REMOVE, WE USE THE VALUE DIFFERENCE METRIC, WHICH PROVES TO BE MORE SUITABLE FOR NOMINAL ATTRIBUTES LIKE THE ONES THIS WORK DEALS WITH, UNLIKE THE EUCLIDEAN DISTANCE, WHICH HAS BEEN USED TRADITIONALLY IN ONE-SIDED SAMPLING.

IF PATIENTS WERE INCORRECTLY IDENTIFIED AS HAVING A POSTOPERATIVE COMPLICATION BY NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING ANALYSIS OF ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS AND NOT STUDIED FURTHER WITH MANUAL RECORD REVIEW, HOSPITALS MIGHT OVER REPORT THEIR POSTSURGICAL COMPLICATION RATES, LEADING TO BOTH POOR QUALITY SCORES AND LOSS OF INCOME AS VALUE-BASED PURCHASING AGREEMENTS BECOME MORE WIDESPREAD.

FEWER STUDIES HAVE LOOKED AT THE PROCESSES OCCURRING WITHIN THE PBL GROUP, CONSIDERING THAT A KEY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PBL AND TRADITIONAL TEACHING IS THE AMOUNT OF TALKING IN WHICH STUDENTS ENGAGE: A TYPICAL PBL WEEK MIGHT INVOLVE 3-5 HOURS OF TALK. LITTLE RESEARCH HAS ATTEMPTED TO CAPTURE THE VOCABULARY USED OR TO ANALYSE THE COGNITIVE PROCESSES THAT OCCUR DURING PBL DISCUSSIONS AND THAT MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO THE ADVANTAGES OF THIS METHOD OF LEARNING. METHODS: WE PROFESSIONALLY TRANSCRIBED A RECORDING OF A FACILITATOR AND SEVEN STUDENTS ENGAGING IN A PBL CASE CONSISTING OF THREE SESSIONS. THE TEXT WAS ANALYSED BY USING WMATRIX2 (UCREL, LANCASTER UNIVERSITY, UK), A POWERFUL LINGUISTIC PROGRAM USED FOR CORPUS ANALYSIS. THIS ALLOWED THE INTER-SESSIONAL COMPARATIVE QUANTIFICATION OF THE USE OF TECHNICAL VOCABULARY, AS WELL AS OF REASONING, QUESTIONING AND EXPLAINING EPISODES.

THE KERNEL IS AN INNER PRODUCT IN THE FEATURE SPACE GENERATED BY ALL SUBSEQUENCES OF LENGTH K. A SUBSEQUENCE IS ANY ORDERED SEQUENCE OF K CHARACTERS OCCURRING IN THE TEXT THOUGH NOT NECESSARILY CONTIGUOUSLY. THE SUBSEQUENCES ARE WEIGHTED BY AN EXPONENTIALLY DECAYING FACTOR OF THEIR FULL LENGTH IN THE TEXT, HENCE EMPHASIZING THOSE OCCURRENCES THAT ARE CLOSE TO CONTIGUOUS. A DIRECT COMPUTATION OF THIS FEATURE VECTOR WOULD INVOLVE A PROHIBITIVE AMOUNT OF COMPUTATION EVEN FOR MODEST VALUES OF K, SINCE THE DIMENSION OF THE FEATURE SPACE GROWS EXPONENTIALLY WITH K. THE PAPER DESCRIBES HOW DESPITE THIS FACT THE INNER PRODUCT CAN BE EFFICIENTLY EVALUATED BY A DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING TECHNIQUE. EXPERIMENTAL COMPARISONS OF THE PERFORMANCE OF THE KERNEL COMPARED WITH A STANDARD WORD FEATURE SPACE KERNEL (T. JOACHIMS, 1998) SHOW POSITIVE RESULTS ON MODESTLY SIZED DATASETS.

TEXT MINING CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF KNOWLEDGE STORED IN TEXTUAL DOCUMENTS, REDUCING THE EFFORT FOR KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION. THE APPROACH CONSISTS IN PERFORMING A MINING PROCESS ON CONCEPTS PRESENT IN TEXTS INSTEAD OF WORKING WITH WORDS. THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT CONCEPTS REPRESENT REAL-WORLD EVENTS AND CHARACTERISTICS BETTER THAN WORDS, ALLOWING THE UNDERSTANDING AND THE EXPLANATION OF THE REASONING USED IN DECISION PROCESSES. THE PROPOSED APPROACH EXTRACTS CONCEPTS EXPRESSED IN NATURAL PHRASES, AND THEN ANALYZES THEIR DISTRIBUTIONS AND ASSOCIATIONS. CONCEPT DISTRIBUTIONS AND ASSOCIATIONS ARE USED TO CHARACTERIZE CLASSES OR SITUATIONS. AFTER THE DISCOVERY PROCESS, THE OBTAINED KNOWLEDGE CAN BE EMBEDDED IN AUTOMATED SYSTEMS TO CLASSIFY ELEMENTS OR TO SUGGEST ACTIONS OR SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS. THE APPROACH WAS USED TO ANALYZE CONCEPTS EXTRACTED FROM TEXTUAL MEDICAL RECORDS, PARTICULARLY PATIENTS' SYMPTOMS, SIGNALS, AND SOCIAL/BEHAVIOR CHARACTERISTICS.

HOWEVER, LITTLE ATTENTION HAS BEEN DEVOTED TO THE SEMANTIC ASPECTS OF APHASIC SENTENCE COMPREHENSION. AIMS: THE PRIMARY AIM OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO VALIDATE THE USE OF A COMPUTATIONAL SEMANTIC APPROACH FOR MODELLING APHASIC SENTENCE COMPREHENSION. METHODS & PROCEDURES: THE MODEL PRESENTED HERE IS AN EXTENSION OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING SOFTWARE DESIGNED BY BLACKBURN AND BOS (2006). THE ORIGINAL PROGRAM PARSES A NATURAL LANGUAGE EXPRESSION BY MEANS OF A SIMPLE DEFINITE CLAUSE GRAMMAR, ASSIGNING A SEMANTIC REPRESENTATION TO EACH NODE IN THE PARSE TREE. THE FINAL RESULT OF A SUCCESSFUL PARSE IS A SENTENCE FROM FIRST-ORDER LOGIC THAT DESCRIBES THE MEANING OF THE NATURAL LANGUAGE SENTENCE. THE PROGRAM WAS MADE RELEVANT FOR THE STUDY OF APHASIA BY EXTENDING THE GRAMMAR TO PARSE 14 SENTENCES THAT PRESENT VARIABLE DEGREES OF DIFFICULTY TO APHASIC PATIENTS. IN ADDITION, EACH CONSTITUENT IN THE GRAMMAR WAS ENDOWED WITH AN INTEGRITY FEATURE THAT CONTAINED AN INTEGER WITH A MAXIMUM VALUE OF 100. THIS NUMBER CONSTITUTED THE PERCENT CHANCE THAT THE NODE WOULD BE SUCCESSFULLY REALISED AND WAS REDUCED IN PROPORTION TO THE NODES HEIGHT IN THE SYNTACTIC TREE. THE CONSTANT OF PROPORTIONALITY WAS THEN MANIPULATED TO SIMULATE VARIOUS DEGREES OF APHASIA SEVERITY. QUALITIES OF THE MODELS PERFORMANCE WERE COMPARED TO QUALITIES OF APHASIC PATIENT PERFORMANCE ON FOUR KEY SENTENCES.

ADDITIONALLY, THE VALIDITY OF TEXT CATEGORIZATION AND IRT, COMBINED WITH MODEL MEASUREMENT, WERE EXPLORED; TEXT CATEGORIZATION RESULTS WERE USED AS PRIOR INFORMATION WHEN ESTIMATING IRT CAPABILITY PARAMETERS TO TEST WHETHER ADDING PRIOR INFORMATION CAN IMPROVE ACCURACY. THIS STUDY DRAWS THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS: (1) THE TEXT CLASSIFICATION METHOD HAD THE HIGHEST SENSITIVITY IN 300-PERSON SAMPLES; HOWEVER, THE TEXT-IRT METHOD HAD THE BEST PREDICTIVE EFFECT, HIGH RELIABILITY, AND UNIQUE ADVANTAGES IN ACCURACY. (2) IN 600-PERSON SAMPLES, THE TEXT CLASSIFICATION METHOD HAD THE BEST PREDICTIVE EFFECT. THE EFFECT WAS RELATIVELY GOOD, WITH UNIQUE ADVANTAGES IN IDENTIFYING LOW CAREER ADAPTABILITY. HOWEVER, THIS MUST BE SELECTED ACCORDING TO ACTUAL NEEDS. IF THE ACCURACY REQUIREMENT IS HIGH AND SENSITIVITY CAN BE SACRIFICED, THE TEXT-IRT METHOD IS MORE APPROPRIATE. (3) THE TEXT-IRT METHOD IS MORE SUITABLE FOR 900 SUBJECTS WHEN ACCURACY, SENSITIVITY, AND SPECIFICITY NEED TO BE CONSIDERED, AND TEXT CLASSIFICATION IS BEST WHEN IDENTIFYING LOW CAREER ADAPTABILITY.

"2176","O'HANLON CE, 2019, ","INTRODUCTION HEART DISEASE KILLS NEARLY 300,000 US WOMEN ANNUALLY, WHILE APPROXIMATELY 40,000 US WOMEN DIE OF BREAST CANCER. BREAST CANCER ONLINE PATIENT COMMUNITIES ARE WELL KNOWN FOR THEIR HIGH ENGAGEMENT AND EMOTIONAL SUPPORT. THIS EXPLORATORY STUDY COMPARED SOCIAL MEDIA DISCOURSE ON BREAST CANCER WITH DISCOURSE RELATED TO HEART DISEASE. METHODS COMPUTER-ASSISTED TEXT ANALYSIS OF TWO CORPORA COMPOSED OF TWITTER POSTS USING #BREASTCANCER AND #HEARTDISEASE HASHTAGS FROM DECEMBER 2013 TO DECEMBER 2014. LEXICAL ANALYSIS (WORD AND HASHTAG LEVEL) USED ANTCONC SOFTWARE AND LEXICOGRAMMATICAL ANALYSIS (STYLE AND STANCE) WAS CONDUCTED WITH DOCUSCOPE. RESULTS THE #BREASTCANCER CORPUS CONSISTED OF 592,046 POSTS, 57% OF WHICH WERE NOT ORIGINAL TO THE USER (RETWEETS). #HEARTDISEASE HAD 269,769 POSTS (13% RETWEETS). SOCIAL MEDIA DISCOURSE ABOUT #BREASTCANCER AND #HEARTDISEASE DREW ATTENTION TO WOMEN, NEW DEVELOPMENTS, APPEALS FOR HELP AND DISEASE RISKS. THE #BREASTCANCER CORPUS INCORPORATES GENDERED LANGUAGE AND ASSOCIATIONS WITH ART AND ACTIVISM, WHILE POSTS ABOUT #HEARTDISEASE WERE DISCUSSED SCIENTIFICALLY IN CONCERT WITH OTHER DISEASES. THE #BREASTCANCER CORPUS UNIQUELY INCLUDED COMMUNITY-SPECIFIC INITIALISM HASHTAGS. STANCE ANALYSIS OF THE #BREASTCANCER CORPUS REVEALED MORE SOCIALLY ORIENTED POSTS, MARKED BY LANGUAGE OF CONSTRUCTIVE REASONING, INCLUSIVE LANGUAGE AND ABSTRACT THOUGHT, WHILE #HEARTDISEASE CORPUS POSTS WERE MORE SCHOLARLY, USED CONTINGENT AND OPPOSITIONAL REASONING, LANGUAGE FROM INSTITUTIONAL AND ACADEMIC REGISTERS, CITATIONS AND META-DISCOURSE. CONCLUSION THE #HEARTDISEASE SOCIAL MEDIA COMMUNITY IS LESS ENGAGED, AND CONTENT IS LESS SPECIFIC TO BOTH THE DISEASE AND INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCE THAN #BREASTCANCER.

MOST EXISTING SOLUTIONS FOCUS ON COMPOSING MUSIC THAT APPEARS THEORETICALLY CORRECT OR INTERESTING TO THE LISTENER. HOWEVER, FEW METHODS HAVE TARGETED SENTIMENT-BASED MUSIC COMPOSITION: GENERATING MUSIC THAT EXPRESSES HUMAN EMOTIONS. THE FEW EXISTING METHODS ARE RESTRICTED IN THE SPECTRUM OF EMOTIONS THEY CAN EXPRESS (USUALLY TO TWO DIMENSIONS: VALENCE AND AROUSAL) AS WELL AS THE LEVEL OF SOPHISTICATION OF THE MUSIC THEY COMPOSE (USUALLY MONOPHONIC, FOLLOWING TRANSLATION-BASED, PREDEFINED TEMPLATES OR HEURISTIC TEXTURES). IN THIS PAPER, WE INTRODUCE A NEW ALGORITHMIC FRAMEWORK FOR AUTONOMOUS MUSIC SENTIMENT-BASED EXPRESSION AND COMPOSITION, TITLED MUSEC, THAT PERCEIVES AN EXTENSIBLE SET OF SIX PRIMARY HUMAN EMOTIONS (E.G., ANGER, FEAR, JOY, LOVE, SADNESS, AND SURPRISE) EXPRESSED BY A MIDI MUSICAL FILE AND THEN COMPOSES (CREATES) NEW POLYPHONIC (PSEUDO) THEMATIC, AND DIVERSIFIED MUSICAL PIECES THAT EXPRESS THESE EMOTIONS. UNLIKE EXISTING SOLUTIONS, MUSEC IS: (I) A HYBRID CROSSOVER BETWEEN SUPERVISED LEARNING (SL, TO LEARN SENTIMENTS FROM MUSIC) AND EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION (FOR MUSIC COMPOSITION, MC), WHERE SL SERVES AT THE FITNESS FUNCTION OF MC TO COMPOSE MUSIC THAT EXPRESSES TARGET SENTIMENTS, (II) EXTENSIBLE IN THE PANEL OF EMOTIONS IT CAN CONVEY, PRODUCING PIECES THAT REFLECT A TARGET CRISP SENTIMENT (E.G., LOVE) OR A COLLECTION OF FUZZY SENTIMENTS (E.G., 65% HAPPY, 20% SAD, AND 15% ANGRY), COMPARED WITH CRISP-ONLY OR TWO-DIMENSIONAL (VALENCE/AROUSAL) SENTIMENT MODELS USED IN EXISTING SOLUTIONS, (III) ADOPTS THE EVOLUTIONARY-DEVELOPMENTAL MODEL, USING AN EXTENSIVE SET OF SPECIALLY DESIGNED MUSIC-THEORETIC MUTATION OPERATORS (TRILLE, STACCATO, REPEAT, COMPRESS, ETC.), STOCHASTICALLY ORCHESTRATED TO ADD ATOMIC (INDIVIDUAL CHORD-LEVEL) AND THEMATIC (CHORD PATTERN-LEVEL) VARIABILITY TO THE COMPOSED POLYPHONIC PIECES, COMPARED WITH TRADITIONAL EVOLUTIONARY SOLUTIONS PRODUCING MONOPHONIC AND NON-THEMATIC MUSIC. WE CONDUCTED A LARGE BATTERY OF TESTS TO EVALUATE MUSEC'S EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY IN BOTH SENTIMENT ANALYSIS AND COMPOSITION.

OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMED TO DEVELOP A SYSTEMATIC FRAMEWORK FOR QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF PATIENT-GENERATED NARRATIVES IN ONLINE HEALTH CARE FORUMS. METHODS: OUR SYSTEMATIC FRAMEWORK CONSISTS OF 4 PHASES: (1) DATA COLLECTION, (2) DATA PREPARATION, (3) CONTENT ANALYSIS, AND (4) INTERPRETATION OF THE RESULTS. DATA COLLECTION AND DATA PREPARATION PHASES ARE CONSTRUCTED BASED ON TEXT MINING METHODS FOR IDENTIFYING APPROPRIATE ONLINE HEALTH FORUMS FOR DATA COLLECTION, DIFFERENTIATING POSTS OF PATIENTS FROM OTHER STAKEHOLDERS, PROTECTING PATIENTS' PRIVACY, SAMPLING, AND CHOOSING THE UNIT OF ANALYSIS. CONTENT ANALYSIS PHASE IS BUILT ON THE FRAMEWORK METHOD, WHICH FACILITATES AND ACCELERATES THE IDENTIFICATION OF PATTERNS AND THEMES BY AN INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH TEAM.

"2202","LEE YJ, 2019, ","OBJECTIVE: THE STUDY SOUGHT TO EXPLORE ONLINE HEALTH COMMUNITIES (OHCS) FOR SEXUAL MINORITY WOMEN (SMW) WITH CANCER BY CONDUCTING COMPUTATIONAL TEXT ANALYSIS ON POSTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: EIGHT MODERATED OHCS WERE HOSTED BY THE NATIONAL LGBT CANCER NETWORK FROM 2013 TO 2015. FORTY-SIX SMW WROTE A TOTAL OF 885 POSTS ACROSS THE OHCS, WHICH WERE ANALYZED USING LINGUISTIC INQUIRY AND WORD COUNT AND LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION. PEARSON CORRELATION WAS CALCULATED BETWEEN LINGUISTIC INQUIRY AND WORD COUNT WORD CATEGORIES AND PARTICIPANT ENGAGEMENT IN THE OHCS. LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION WAS USED TO DERIVE MAIN TOPICS. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS (AVERAGE AGE 46 YEARS; 89% WHITE/NON-HISPANIC) WHO USED MORE SADNESS, FEMALE-REFERENCE, DRIVES, AND RELIGION-RELATED WORDS WERE MORE LIKELY TO POST IN THE OHCS. TEN TOPICS EMERGED: COPING, HOLIDAYS AND VACATION, CANCER DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT, STRUCTURE OF DAY-TO-DAY LIFE, SELF-CARE, LOVED ONES, PHYSICAL RECOVERY, SUPPORT SYSTEMS, BODY IMAGE, AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT. COPING WAS THE MOST COMMON TOPIC; SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT WAS THE LEAST COMMON TOPIC. DISCUSSION: HIGHLY ENGAGED SMW IN THE OHCS CONNECTED TO OTHERS VIA THEIR SHARED FEMALE GENDER IDENTITY. TOPICS DISCUSSED IN THESE OHCS WERE SIMILAR TO OHCS FOR HETEROSEXUAL WOMEN, AND SEXUAL IDENTITY WAS NOT A DOMINANT TOPIC. THE PRESENCE OF OHC MODERATORS MAY HAVE DRIVEN PARTICIPATION. FORMAL COMPARISON BETWEEN SEXUAL MINORITY AND HETEROSEXUAL WOMEN'S OHCS ARE NEEDED. CONCLUSIONS: OUR FINDINGS CONTRIBUTE TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE EXPERIENCES OF SMW CANCER SURVIVORS AND CAN INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF TAILORED OHC-BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR SMW WHO ARE SURVIVORS OF CANCER.",1,0,0

"2204","WILLIAMS L, 2019, ","IN THIS PAPER WE INVESTIGATED THE UTILITY OF DIFFERENT CLASSIFICATION SCHEMES FOR EMOTIVE LANGUAGE ANALYSIS WITH THE AIM OF PROVIDING EXPERIMENTAL JUSTIFICATION FOR THE CHOICE OF SCHEME FOR CLASSIFYING EMOTIONS IN FREE TEXT. WE COMPARED SIX SCHEMES: (1) EKMAN'S SIX BASIC EMOTIONS, (2) PLUTCHIK'S WHEEL OF EMOTION, (3) WATSON AND TELLEGEN'S CIRCUMPLEX THEORY OF AFFECT, (4) THE EMOTION ANNOTATION REPRESENTATION LANGUAGE (EARL), (5) WORDNET-AFFECT, AND (6) FREE TEXT. TO MEASURE THEIR UTILITY, WE INVESTIGATED THEIR EASE OF USE BY HUMAN ANNOTATORS AS WELL AS THE PERFORMANCE OF SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING. WE ASSEMBLED A CORPUS OF 500 EMOTIONALLY CHARGED TEXT DOCUMENTS. THE CORPUS WAS ANNOTATED MANUALLY USING AN ONLINE CROWDSOURCING PLATFORM WITH FIVE INDEPENDENT ANNOTATORS PER DOCUMENT. ASSUMING THAT CLASSIFICATION SCHEMES WITH A BETTER BALANCE BETWEEN COMPLETENESS AND COMPLEXITY ARE EASIER TO INTERPRET AND USE, WE EXPECT SUCH SCHEMES TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER INTER-ANNOTATOR AGREEMENT. WE USED KRIPPENDORFF'S ALPHA COEFFICIENT TO MEASURE INTER-ANNOTATOR AGREEMENT ACCORDING TO WHICH THE SIX CLASSIFICATION SCHEMES WERE RANKED AS FOLLOWS: (1) SIX BASIC EMOTIONS (ALPHA = 0.483), (2) WHEEL OF EMOTION (ALPHA = 0.410), (3) CIRCUMPLEX (ALPHA = 0.312), EARL (ALPHA = 0.286), (5) FREE TEXT (ALPHA = 0.205), AND (6) WORDNET-AFFECT (ALPHA = 0.202). HOWEVER, CORRESPONDENCE ANALYSIS OF ANNOTATIONS ACROSS THE SCHEMES HIGHLIGHTED THAT BASIC EMOTIONS ARE OVERSIMPLIFIED REPRESENTATIONS OF COMPLEX PHENOMENA AND AS SUCH LIKELY TO LEAD TO INVALID INTERPRETATIONS, WHICH ARE NOT NECESSARILY REFLECTED BY HIGH INTER-ANNOTATOR AGREEMENT. TO COMPLEMENT THE RESULT OF THE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS, WE USED SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS TO GAIN A QUALITATIVE INSIGHT INTO HOW ANNOTATORS INTERACTED WITH AND INTERPRETED THE CHOSEN SCHEMES. THE SIZE OF THE CLASSIFICATION SCHEME WAS HIGHLIGHTED AS A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR AFFECTING ANNOTATION. IN PARTICULAR, THE SCHEME OF SIX BASIC EMOTIONS WAS PERCEIVED AS HAVING INSUFFICIENT COVERAGE OF THE EMOTION SPACE FORCING ANNOTATORS TO OFTEN RESORT TO INFERIOR ALTERNATIVES, E.G. USING HAPPINESS AS A SURROGATE FOR LOVE. ON THE OPPOSITE END OF THE SPECTRUM, LARGE SCHEMES SUCH AS WORDNET-AFFECT WERE LINKED TO CHOICE FATIGUE, WHICH INCURRED SIGNIFICANT COGNITIVE EFFORT IN CHOOSING THE BEST ANNOTATION. IN THE SECOND PART OF THE STUDY, WE USED THE ANNOTATED CORPUS TO CREATE SIX TRAINING DATASETS, ONE FOR EACH SCHEME. THE TRAINING DATA WERE USED IN CROSS-VALIDATION EXPERIMENTS TO EVALUATE CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE IN RELATION TO DIFFERENT SCHEMES. ACCORDING TO THE F-MEASURE, THE CLASSIFICATION SCHEMES WERE RANKED AS FOLLOWS: (1) SIX BASIC EMOTIONS (F = 0.410), (2) CIRCUMPLEX (F = 0.341), (3) WHEEL OF EMOTION (F = 0.293), (4) EARL (F = 0.254), (5) FREE TEXT (F = 0.159) AND (6) WORDNET-AFFECT (F = 0.158). NOT SURPRISINGLY, THE SMALLEST SCHEME WAS RANKED THE HIGHEST IN BOTH CRITERIA. THEREFORE, OUT OF THE SIX SCHEMES STUDIED HERE, SIX BASIC EMOTIONS ARE BEST SUITED FOR EMOTIVE LANGUAGE ANALYSIS. HOWEVER, BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS HIGHLIGHTED ITS MAJOR SHORTCOMING - OVERSIMPLIFICATION OF POSITIVE EMOTIONS, WHICH ARE ALL CONFLATED INTO HAPPINESS.

"2205","LIU J, 2020, ","BACKGROUND: USER-GENERATED CONTENT SHARED IN THE ONLINE HEALTH COMMUNITIES (OHCS) IS BECOMING A VALUABLE RESOURCE FOR RESEARCHERS TO UNDERSTAND PATIENTS' DECISION-MAKING BEHAVIORS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THEIR HEALTH. MANY STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED ON HOW TO OBTAIN USEFUL INFORMATION FROM ONLINE REVIEWS IN OHCS. INTRODUCTION: THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON A TELEMEDICINE SERVICE CALLED ONLINE PRIVATE DOCTOR (OPD), WHICH IS OFFERED BY A LEADING CHINESE PHYSICIAN REVIEW WEBSITE (PRW). OPD REVIEWS HAVE NOT RECEIVED MUCH ATTENTION. BY DATA MINING THE REVIEWS, OUR GOAL IS TO DETERMINE WHAT PATIENTS ARE TALKING ABOUT WHEN THEY USE THE OPD SERVICE AND WHETHER THEY ARE SATISFIED WITH THE SERVICE OR NOT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: WE USED A PYTHON WEB CRAWLER TO COLLECT 41,029 REVIEWS AND 84,510 SHORT REVIEWS (LABELS) OF ALL 5,645 PHYSICIANS WHO OFFERED THE OPD SERVICE ON A PRW (HAODF.COM) IN CHINA. MIXED METHODS (I.E., A LITERATURE REVIEW, TOPIC DISCOVERY, ANNOTATION, AND A SENTIMENT ANALYSIS) WERE USED TO DETERMINE THE INFORMATION THAT THE OPD REVIEWS ARE MEANT TO EXPRESS. RESULTS: WE DISCOVERED THAT THE OPD REVIEWS CAN BE CATEGORIZED INTO FOUR SUBJECTS: COMPETENCE (35.1%), COMMUNICATION (29.4%), TREATMENT (26.0%), AND CONVENIENCE (9.5%). IN TERMS OF PREVIOUSLY DISCOVERED TOPICS, WE FOUND THAT COMPETENCE, COMMUNICATION, AND TREATMENT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED BEFORE, BUT CONVENIENCE IS AN EMERGING SUBJECT. THE SENTIMENT ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT 93.67% OF THE REVIEWS INDICATED POSITIVE EMOTIONS, AND THE AREA UNDER THE RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC (ROC) CURVE IS 0.64. FURTHERMORE, THE LABELS INDICATED THAT ONLY 0.72% (603/84,570) OF REVIEWS WERE NEGATIVE TOWARD THE OPD SERVICE. THE SUBJECTS OF THE LABELS WERE DISTRIBUTED ACCORDING TO COMPETENCE (34.7%), COMMUNICATION (23.8%), TREATMENT (33.5%), AND CONVENIENCE (8.0%). DISCUSSION: THE FINDINGS OF OUR STUDY SUGGEST THAT PATIENTS WHO EVER USED OPD HAVE BEEN QUITE SATISFIED WITH THE SERVICE. FROM THEIR REVIEWS, WE DISCOVERED THAT OPD HAS ITS SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS AND IS CONVENIENT. HOWEVER, IT STILL HAS SOME SHORTCOMINGS, FOR EXAMPLE, THE QUALITY OF THE PHONE CONNECTION. IN TERMS OF BOTH THE PLATFORM AND THE DOCTORS, MORE EFFORTS SHOULD BE MADE TO MAKE THE OPD BETTER AND MORE REGULATED. CONCLUSION: OPD IS AN EMERGING TELEMEDICINE SERVICE THAT STILL NEEDS MORE TIME AND SPACE TO EVOLVE. FOR PATIENTS, IT HELPS REDUCE PROBLEMS SUCH AS SCHEDULING AND QUEUING. THEREFORE, IT BRINGS MORE CONVENIENCE TO PEOPLE'S DAILY LIVES. IN THE FUTURE, MORE ATTENTION SHOULD BE PAID TO THIS SERVICE, AS IT IS HELPFUL IN REDUCING THE UNEVEN DISTRIBUTION OF MEDICAL RESOURCES.",1,1,0

OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO CREATE A CORPUS OF PATIENT EXPERIENCE (COPE) AND REPORT DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS TO CHARACTERIZE COPE. METHODS: YELP REVIEWS ABOUT HEALTH CARE-RELATED BUSINESSES WERE EXTRACTED FROM THE YELP ACADEMIC DATASET. NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) TOOLS WERE USED TO SPLIT REVIEWS INTO SENTENCES, EXTRACT NOUN PHRASES AND ADJECTIVES FROM EACH SENTENCE, AND GENERATE PARSE TREES AND DEPENDENCY TREES FOR EACH SENTENCE. SENTIMENT ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES AND HADOOP WERE USED TO CALCULATE A SENTIMENT SCORE OF EACH SENTENCE AND FOR PARALLEL PROCESSING, RESPECTIVELY. RESULTS: COPE CONTAINS 79,173 SENTENCES FROM 6914 PATIENT REVIEWS OF 985 HEALTH CARE FACILITIES NEAR 30 UNIVERSITIES IN THE UNITED STATES. WE FOUND THAT PATIENTS WROTE LONGER REVIEWS WHEN THEY RATED THE FACILITY POORLY (1 OR 2 STARS). WE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE COMPUTED SENTIMENT SCORES CORRELATED WELL WITH CONSUMER-GENERATED RATINGS. A CONSUMER VOCABULARY TO DESCRIBE THEIR HEALTH CARE EXPERIENCE WAS CONSTRUCTED BY A STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF WORD COUNTS AND CO-OCCURRENCES IN COPE. CONCLUSIONS: A CORPUS CALLED COPE WAS BUILT AS AN INITIAL STEP TO UTILIZE SOCIAL MEDIA TO UNDERSTAND PATIENT EXPERIENCES AT HEALTH CARE FACILITIES.

PATIENTS WERE CONCERNED MOST ABOUT SYMPTOM TOPICS RELATED TO LUNG CANCER (536/1657, 32.34%), DRUG TOPICS RELATED TO DIABETES (1883/5904, 31.89%), AND EXAMINATION TOPICS RELATED TO BREAST CANCER (8728/23,934, 36.47%). BY COMPARISON, CAREGIVERS WERE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT DRUG TOPICS RELATED TO LUNG CANCER (300/2721, 11.03% VS 109/1657, 6.58%), PROCEDURE TOPICS RELATED TO BREAST CANCER (3952/13,954, 28.32% VS 5822/23,934, 24.33%), AND COMPLICATION TOPICS (4449/25,701, 17.31% VS 4070/31,495, 12.92%). IN ADDITION, PATIENTS (9040/36,081, 25.05%) WERE MORE LIKELY THAN CAREGIVERS (2659/18,470, 14.39%) AND SPECIALISTS (17,943/83,610, 21.46%) TO EXPRESS THEIR EMOTIONS. HOWEVER, PATIENTS' SENTIMENT INTENSITY SCORE (2.46) WAS LOWER THAN THOSE OF CAREGIVERS (4.66) AND SPECIALISTS (5.14). IN PARTICULAR, FOR CAREGIVERS, NEGATIVE SENTIMENT SCORES WERE HIGHER THAN POSITIVE SCORES (2.56 VS 2.18), WITH THE OPPOSITE AMONG SPECIALISTS (2.62 VS 2.46). OVERALL, THE PROPORTION OF NEGATIVE MESSAGES WAS GREATER THAN THAT OF POSITIVE MESSAGES RELATED TO SYMPTOM, COMPLICATION, AND EXAMINATION. THE PATTERN WAS OPPOSITE FOR DRUG AND PROCEDURE TOPICS. A TREND ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS GRADUALLY CHANGED THEIR EMOTIONAL STATE IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION. CONCLUSIONS: THE HOT TOPICS OF INTEREST AND SENTIMENT EXPRESSION DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY AMONG DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS IN DIFFERENT DISEASE FORUMS.

"2221","METWALLY O, 2017, ","BACKGROUND: ALTHOUGH CANCER SCREENING REDUCES MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WORLDWIDE REMAIN UNSCREENED. SOCIAL MEDIA PROVIDE A UNIQUE PLATFORM TO UNDERSTAND PUBLIC SENTIMENT TOWARD TOOLS THAT ARE COMMONLY USED FOR CANCER SCREENING. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF OUR STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE PUBLIC SENTIMENT TOWARD COLONOSCOPY, MAMMOGRAPHY, AND PAP SMEAR AND HOW THIS SENTIMENT SPREADS BY ANALYZING DISCOURSE ON TWITTER. METHODS: IN THIS OBSERVATIONAL STUDY, WE CLASSIFIED 32,847 TWEETS (ONLINE POSTINGS ON TWITTER) RELATED TO COLONOSCOPY, MAMMOGRAPHY, OR PAP SMEARS USING A NAIVE BAYES ALGORITHM AS CONTAINING POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, OR NEUTRAL SENTIMENT. ADDITIONALLY, WE CHARACTERIZED THE SPREAD OF SENTIMENT ON TWITTER USING AN ESTABLISHED MODEL TO STUDY CONTAGION. RESULTS: COLONOSCOPY-RELATED TWEETS WERE MORE LIKELY TO EXPRESS NEGATIVE THAN POSITIVE SENTIMENT (NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE RATIO 1.65, 95% CI 1.51-1.80, P<.001), IN CONTRAST TO THE MORE POSITIVE SENTIMENT EXPRESSED REGARDING MAMMOGRAPHY (NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE RATIO 0.43, 95% CI 0.39-0.47, P<.001). THE PROPORTIONS OF NEGATIVE VERSUS POSITIVE TWEETS ABOUT PAP SMEAR WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT (NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE RATIO 0.95, 95% CI 0.87-1.04, P=.18). POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE TWEETS TENDED TO SHARE LEXICAL FEATURES ACROSS SCREENING MODALITIES. POSITIVE TWEETS EXPRESSED RESONANCE WITH THE BENEFITS OF EARLY DETECTION. FEAR AND PAIN WERE THE PRINCIPAL LEXICAL FEATURES SEEN IN NEGATIVE TWEETS. NEGATIVE SENTIMENT FOR COLONOSCOPY AND MAMMOGRAPHY SPREAD MORE THAN POSITIVE SENTIMENT; NO CORRELATION WITH SENTIMENT AND SPREAD WAS SEEN FOR PAP SMEAR. CONCLUSIONS: ANALYSIS OF SOCIAL MEDIA DATA PROVIDES A UNIQUE, QUANTITATIVE FRAMEWORK TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE PUBLIC'S PERCEPTION OF MEDICAL INTERVENTIONS THAT ARE COMMONLY USED FOR CANCER SCREENING.

SOCIAL MEDIA INCLUDES INFORMAL VOCABULARY AND IRREGULAR GRAMMAR, WHICH CHALLENGE NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING METHODS. OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO DEVELOP A SCALABLE, DEEP-LEARNING APPROACH THAT EXCEEDS STATE-OF-THE-ART ADR DETECTION PERFORMANCE IN SOCIAL MEDIA. MATERIALS AND METHODS:WE DEVELOPED A RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK (RNN) MODEL THAT LABELS WORDS IN AN INPUT SEQUENCE WITH ADR MEMBERSHIP TAGS. THE ONLY INPUT FEATURES ARE WORD-EMBEDDING VECTORS, WHICH CAN BE FORMED THROUGH TASK-INDEPENDENT PRETRAINING OR DURING ADR DETECTION TRAINING. RESULTS:OUR BEST-PERFORMING RNN MODEL USED PRETRAINED WORD EMBEDDINGS CREATED FROM A LARGE, NON-DOMAIN-SPECIFIC TWITTER DATASET. IT ACHIEVED AN APPROXIMATE MATCH F-MEASURE OF 0.755 FOR ADR IDENTIFICATION ON THE DATASET, COMPARED TO 0.631 FOR A BASELINE LEXICON SYSTEM AND 0.65 FOR THE STATE-OF-THE-ART CONDITIONAL RANDOM FIELD MODEL.

METHODS WE FIRST CREATED AN INDICATIONS KNOWLEDGE BASE USING DATA FROM DRUG LABELS, CLINICAL GUIDELINES, EXPERT OPINION, AND OTHER SOURCES. WE ALSO OBTAINED THE LIST OF CURRENT PROBLEMS FOR 200 RANDOMLY SELECTED INPATIENTS WHO RECEIVED PPIS USING A NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING SYSTEM AND THE DISCHARGE SUMMARIES OF THOSE PATIENTS. THESE PROBLEMS WERE CHECKED AGAINST THE INDICATIONS KNOWLEDGE BASE TO IDENTIFY OVERUSE CANDIDATES. TWO GASTROENTEROLOGISTS MANUALLY REVIEWED THE NOTES AND IDENTIFIED CASES OF OVERUSE. RESULTS FROM THE AUTOMATED FRAMEWORK WERE COMPARED WITH THE MANUAL REVIEW. RESULTS REVIEWERS HAD HIGH INTERRATER RELIABILITY IN FINDING INDICATIONS (AGREEMENT=92.1%, COHEN'S =0.773).

REVIEWERS IDENTIFIED PNES-RELATED VOCABULARY TO INFORM A NLP TOOL CALLED YALE CTAKES EXTENSION (YTEX). USING NLP TECHNIQUES, YTEX ANNOTATES SYNTACTIC CONSTRUCTS, NAMED ENTITIES, AND THEIR NEGATION CONTEXT IN THE EHR. THESE ANNOTATIONS ARE PASSED TO A CLASSIFIER TO DETECT PATIENTS WITHOUT PNES. THE CLASSIFIER WAS EVALUATED BY CALCULATING POSITIVE PREDICTIVE VALUES (PPVS), SENSITIVITY, AND F-SCORE. RESULTS: OF THE 742 IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN VETERANS WHO RECEIVED A DIAGNOSIS OF EPILEPSY OR SEIZURE DISORDER BY VEEG, 44 HAD DOCUMENTED EVENTS ON VEEG: 22 VETERANS (3.0%) HAD DEFINITE PNES ONLY, 20 (2.7%) HAD PROBABLE PNES, AND 2 (0.3%) HAD BOTH PNES AND EPILEPSY DOCUMENTED. THE REMAINING 698 VETERANS DID NOT HAVE EVENTS CAPTURED DURING THE VEEG ADMISSION AND/OR DID NOT HAVE A DEFINITIVE DIAGNOSIS. OUR CLASSIFIER ACHIEVED A PPV OF 93%, A SENSITIVITY OF 99%, AND A F-SCORE OF 96%. CONCLUSION: OUR STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT THE YTEX NLP TOOL AND CLASSIFIER IS HIGHLY ACCURATE IN EXCLUDING PNES, DIAGNOSED WITH VEEG, IN EHR SYSTEMS. THE TOOL MAY BE VERY VALUABLE IN PREVENTING FALSE POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION OF PATIENTS WITH EPILEPSY IN EHR-BASED EPIDEMIOLOGIC RESEARCH.

IN THE PRESENT ARTICLE, WE EVALUATE A NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING SYSTEM FOR ONE PARTICULAR CONSTRUCT THAT HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR SOLVING KEY SOCIETAL ISSUES: INTEGRATIVE COMPLEXITY. WE FIRST REVIEW THE GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE FOR THE VALIDITY OF THE AUTOMATED INTEGRATIVE COMPLEXITY (AUTOIC) METHOD FOR COMPUTER-SCORING INTEGRATIVE COMPLEXITY. WE THEN PROVIDE FIVE NEW VALIDITY TESTS: AUTOIC SUCCESSFULLY DISTINGUISHED FOURTEEN CLASSIC PHILOSOPHIC WORKS FROM A LARGE SAMPLE OF BOTH LAY POPULATIONS AND POLITICAL LEADERS (TEST 1) AND FURTHER DISTINGUISHED CLASSIC PHILOSOPHIC WORKS FROM THE RHETORIC OF DONALD TRUMP AT HIGHER RATES THAN AN ALTERNATIVE SYSTEM (TEST 2). ADDITIONALLY, AUTOIC SUCCESSFULLY REPLICATED KEY FINDINGS FROM THE HAND-SCORED IC LITERATURE ON SMOKING CESSATION (TEST 3), U.S. PRESIDENTS' STATE OF THE UNION SPEECHES (TEST 4), AND THE IDEOLOGY-COMPLEXITY RELATIONSHIP (TEST 5). TAKEN IN TOTAL, THIS LARGE BODY OF EVIDENCE NOT ONLY SUGGESTS THAT AUTOIC IS A VALID SYSTEM FOR SCORING INTEGRATIVE COMPLEXITY, BUT IT ALSO REVEALS IMPORTANT THEORY-BUILDING INSIGHTS INTO KEY ISSUES AT THE INTERSECTION OF SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY (HEALTH, LEADERSHIP, AND IDEOLOGY).

IN CLINICAL NLP PROJECTS, EXPERT ANNOTATORS TRADITIONALLY CREATE THE GOLD STANDARD. HOWEVER, TRADITIONAL ANNOTATION IS EXPENSIVE AND TIME-CONSUMING. TO REDUCE THE COST OF ANNOTATION, GENERAL NLP PROJECTS HAVE TURNED TO CROWDSOURCING BASED ON WEB 2.0 TECHNOLOGY, WHICH INVOLVES SUBMITTING SMALLER SUBTASKS TO A COORDINATED MARKETPLACE OF WORKERS ON THE INTERNET. MANY STUDIES HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED IN THE AREA OF CROWDSOURCING, BUT ONLY A FEW HAVE FOCUSED ON TASKS IN THE GENERAL NLP FIELD AND ONLY A HANDFUL IN THE BIOMEDICAL DOMAIN, USUALLY BASED UPON VERY SMALL PILOT SAMPLE SIZES. IN ADDITION, THE QUALITY OF THE CROWDSOURCED BIOMEDICAL NLP CORPORA WERE NEVER EXCEPTIONAL WHEN COMPARED TO TRADITIONALLY-DEVELOPED GOLD STANDARDS. THE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED RESULTS ON MEDICAL NAMED ENTITY ANNOTATION TASK SHOWED A 0.68 F-MEASURE BASED AGREEMENT BETWEEN CROWDSOURCED AND TRADITIONALLY-DEVELOPED CORPORA. OBJECTIVE: BUILDING UPON PREVIOUS WORK FROM THE GENERAL CROWDSOURCING RESEARCH, THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE USABILITY OF CROWDSOURCING IN THE CLINICAL NLP DOMAIN WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON ACHIEVING HIGH AGREEMENT BETWEEN CROWDSOURCED AND TRADITIONALLY-DEVELOPED CORPORA. METHODS: TO BUILD THE GOLD STANDARD FOR EVALUATING THE CROWDSOURCING WORKERS PERFORMANCE, 1042 CLINICAL TRIAL ANNOUNCEMENTS (CTAS) FROM THE CLINICALTRIALS.GOV WEBSITE WERE RANDOMLY SELECTED AND DOUBLE ANNOTATED FOR MEDICATION NAMES, MEDICATION TYPES, AND LINKED ATTRIBUTES. FOR THE EXPERIMENTS, WE USED CROWDFLOWER, AN AMAZON MECHANICAL TURK-BASED CROWDSOURCING PLATFORM. WE CALCULATED SENSITIVITY, PRECISION, AND F-MEASURE TO EVALUATE THE QUALITY OF THE CROWDS WORK AND TESTED THE STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE (P < .001, CHI-SQUARE TEST) TO DETECT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CROWDSOURCED AND TRADITIONALLY-DEVELOPED ANNOTATIONS. RESULTS: THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CROWDS ANNOTATIONS AND THE TRADITIONALLY-GENERATED CORPORA WAS HIGH FOR: (1) ANNOTATIONS (0.87, F-MEASURE FOR MEDICATION NAMES; 0.73, MEDICATION TYPES), (2) CORRECTION OF PREVIOUS ANNOTATIONS (0.90, MEDICATION NAMES; 0.76, MEDICATION TYPES), AND EXCELLENT FOR (3) LINKING MEDICATIONS WITH THEIR ATTRIBUTES (0.96). SIMPLE VOTING PROVIDED THE BEST JUDGMENT AGGREGATION APPROACH. THERE WAS NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CROWD AND TRADITIONALLY-GENERATED CORPORA. OUR RESULTS SHOWED A 27.9% IMPROVEMENT OVER PREVIOUSLY REPORTED RESULTS ON MEDICATION NAMED ENTITY ANNOTATION TASK. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY OFFERS THREE CONTRIBUTIONS. FIRST, WE PROVED THAT CROWDSOURCING IS A FEASIBLE, INEXPENSIVE, FAST, AND PRACTICAL APPROACH TO COLLECT HIGH-QUALITY ANNOTATIONS FOR CLINICAL TEXT (WHEN PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION WAS EXCLUDED). WE BELIEVE THAT WELL-DESIGNED USER INTERFACES AND RIGOROUS QUALITY CONTROL STRATEGY FOR ENTITY ANNOTATION AND LINKING WERE CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS WORK.

THUS OUR ANALYSIS RELIES ON A COMBINATION OF THEORY- AND DATA-DRIVEN METHODOLOGIES TO ORGANIZE AND CLASSIFY THE CHARACTERISTICS OF CHILD CARE THAT ARE ASSESSED BY PARENTS. WE ALSO USE NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES TO EXAMINE THE AFFECT AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TONES EXPRESSED IN THE REVIEWS. OUR MAIN RESULTS ARE THREEFOLD. FIRST, CONDITIONAL ON CONTRIBUTING A YELP REVIEW, CONSUMERS OVERALL ARE HIGHLY SATISFIED WITH THEIR CHILD CARE PROVIDER, ALTHOUGH THOSE IN HIGHER-INCOME MARKETS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE SATISFIED THAN THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN LOWER-INCOME MARKETS. SECOND, THE PROGRAM CHARACTERISTICS MOST COMMONLY EVALUATED BY CONSUMERS RELATE TO SAFETY, QUALITY OF THE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT, AND CHILD-TEACHER INTERACTIONS. HOWEVER, THOSE IN LOWER- AND HIGHER-INCOME MARKETS EVALUATE DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS IN THEIR REVIEWS. THE FORMER IS MORE LIKELY TO COMMENT ON A PROGRAM'S PRACTICAL FEATURES, SUCH AS ITS PRICING AND ACCESSIBILITY, WHILE THE LATTER IS MORE LIKELY TO FOCUS ON THE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT. FINALLY, WE FIND THAT CONSUMERS IN LOWER-INCOME MARKETS ARE MORE LIKELY TO DISPLAY NEGATIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL TONES SUCH AS ANXIETY AND ANGER IN THEIR REVIEWS, ESPECIALLY WHEN DISCUSSING THE NATURE OF THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH PROGRAM MANAGERS AND THEIR CHILD'S INTERACTIONS WITH TEACHERS.

BACKGROUND: AS THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY ADOPTS NEW TECHNOLOGIES, IT IS IMPORTANT TO SYSTEMATICALLY ASSESS THE EFFECT OF THESE CHANGES ON TRAFFIC SAFETY. DRIVING SIMULATORS, NATURALISTIC DRIVING DATA, AND CRASH DATABASES ALL CONTRIBUTE TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW DRIVERS RESPOND TO CHANGING VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY, BUT OTHER APPROACHES, SUCH AS AUTOMATED ANALYSIS OF INCIDENT REPORTS, ARE NEEDED. METHOD: FREE-RESPONSE DATA FROM INCIDENTS REPRESENTING TWO SEVERITY LEVELS (FATAL INCIDENTS AND INCIDENTS INVOLVING INJURY) WERE ANALYZED USING A TEXT MINING APPROACH: LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS (LSA). LSA AND HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING IDENTIFIED CLUSTERS OF COMPLAINTS FOR EACH SEVERITY LEVEL, WHICH WERE COMPARED AND ANALYZED ACROSS TIME. RESULTS: CLUSTER ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED EIGHT CLUSTERS OF FATAL INCIDENTS AND SIX CLUSTERS OF INCIDENTS INVOLVING INJURY. COMPARISONS SHOWED THAT ALTHOUGH THE AIRBAG CLUSTERS ACROSS THE TWO SEVERITY LEVELS HAVE THE SAME MOST FREQUENT TERMS, THE CIRCUMSTANCES AROUND THE INCIDENTS DIFFER. THE TIME TRENDS SHOW CLEAR INCREASES IN COMPLAINTS SURROUNDING THE FORD/FIRESTONE TIRE RECALL AND THE TOYOTA UNINTENDED ACCELERATION RECALL. INCREASES IN COMPLAINTS MAY BE PARTIALLY DRIVEN BY THESE RECALL ANNOUNCEMENTS AND THE ASSOCIATED MEDIA ATTENTION. CONCLUSION: TEXT MINING CAN REVEAL USEFUL INFORMATION FROM FREE-RESPONSE DATABASES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE PROHIBITIVELY TIME-CONSUMING AND DIFFICULT TO SUMMARIZE MANUALLY. APPLICATION: TEXT MINING CAN EXTEND HUMAN ANALYSIS CAPABILITIES FOR LARGE FREE-RESPONSE DATABASES TO SUPPORT EARLIER DETECTION OF PROBLEMS AND MORE TIMELY SAFETY INTERVENTIONS.

AS AN EXAMPLE, THIS STUDY PRESENTS THE APPLICATION OF TEXTMINING TO ASSESS AND COMPARE INTEREST IN FITNESS TRACKING TECHNOLOGY ACROSS EATING DISORDER AND HEALTHRELATED ONLINE COMMUNITIES. METHOD: A LIST OF FITNESS TRACKING TECHNOLOGY TERMS WAS DEVELOPED, AND COMMUNITIES (I.E., SUBREDDITS) ON A LARGE ONLINE DISCUSSION PLATFORM (REDDIT) WERE COMPARED REGARDING THE FREQUENCY WITH WHICH THESE TERMS OCCURRED. THE CORPUS USED IN THIS STUDY COMPRISED ALL COMMENTS POSTED BETWEEN MAY 2015 AND JANUARY 2018 (INCLUSIVE) ON SIX SUBREDDITSTHREE EATING DISORDERRELATED, AND THREE RELATING TO EITHER FITNESS, WEIGHTMANAGEMENT, OR NUTRITION. ALL COMMENTS RELATING TO THE SAME THREAD (I.E., CONVERSATION) WERE CONCATENATED, AND FORMED THE CASES USED IN THIS STUDY (N = 377,276). RESULTS: WITHIN THE EATING DISORDERRELATED SUBREDDITS, THE FINDINGS INDICATED THAT A PROEATING DISORDER SUBREDDIT, WHICH IS LESS RECOVERY FOCUSED THAN THE OTHER EATING DISORDER SUBREDDITS, HAD THE HIGHEST FREQUENCY OF FITNESS TRACKER TERMS. ACROSS ALL SUBREDDITS, THE WEIGHTMANAGEMENT SUBREDDIT HAD THE HIGHEST FREQUENCY OF THE FITNESS TRACKER TERMS' OCCURRENCE, AND MYFITNESSPAL WAS THE MOST FREQUENTLY MENTIONED FITNESS TRACKER.

DATA WERE EXTRACTED USING STRUCTURED FIELDS, TEXT SEARCHING AND NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING APPLICATIONS. RESULTS: OF 456 PREGNANT WOMEN IDENTIFIED, 236 (51.7%) HAD SCHIZOPHRENIA AND RELATED DISORDERS, 220 (48.3%) HAD AFFECTIVE PSYCHOSIS OR BIPOLAR DISORDER. WOMEN WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA AND RELATED DISORDERS WERE YOUNGER, LESS LIKELY TO HAVE A PARTNER IN PREGNANCY, MORE LIKELY TO BE BLACK, TO SMOKE OR MISUSE SUBSTANCES AND HAD SIGNIFICANTLY MORE TIME IN THE TWO YEARS BEFORE PREGNANCY IN ACUTE CARE (INPATIENT OR INTENSIVE HOME TREATMENT) COMPARED WITH WOMEN WITH AFFECTIVE DISORDERS.

TAKING SATISFACTION, TRUST AND PROMOTION EFFORTS AS THE ANTECEDENTS, AND CONSUMER REPURCHASE INTENTION AS THE CONSEQUENT, A MODEL WAS ESTABLISHED BASED ON EMOTIONAL COMPUTING AND FUZZY REASONING. THROUGH THE SATISFACTION, TRUST AND PROMOTION EFFORT OF FIVE SPORTSWEAR BRANDS IN TAOBAO, WE VERIFIED THE REASONING FOR DETERMINING CONSUMER REPURCHASE INTENTION OF PRODUCTS. MEANWHILE, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE INITIAL PURCHASE INTENTION AND REPURCHASE INTENTION OF CONSUMERS WAS COMPARED, THUS PROVIDING THE BASIS FOR ONLINE STORES TO FORMULATE THEIR MARKETING STRATEGY AND BRAND SEGMENTATION.

THE THERAPEUTIC WRITING SESSIONS WERE OFFERED DURING THE SECOND WEEK OF TREATMENT AT THE NATIONAL INTREPID CENTER OF EXCELLENCE (NICOE) AS PART OF AN INTEGRATIVE CARE MODEL FOR SERVICE MEMBERS (SMS) WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND UNDERLYING PSYCHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS TO INCLUDE POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD). METHOD: THERAPEUTIC WRITING SESSIONS WERE FACILITATED IN THE ART THERAPY STUDIO AT THE NICOE. THE SESSIONS WERE DOCUMENTED IN THE MILITARY HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS PATIENT RECORD APPLICATION BY THE ART THERAPIST AND ART THERAPY INTERNS AT THE NICOE. CLINICAL NOTES WERE INFORMED BY SM SELF-REPORT SURVEYS AND CLINICIAN OBSERVATIONS. NOTES FROM MAY 2012 TO 2015 AND WERE PULLED AND CODED MANUALLY FOR EMERGING THEMES, THEN SEPARATELY ANALYZED BY A COMPUTER SOFTWARE TEXT CONTENT ANALYSIS PROGRAM (PENNEBAKER ET AL., 2015). RESULTS: OVERALL, SMS REPORTED MORE POSITIVE THAN NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL, OR MIXED EMOTIONS DURING AND AFTER THE THERAPEUTIC WRITING EXPERIENCE. SOME REPORTED A CHANGE FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE EMOTIONS THROUGH THE WRITING PROCESS, AND MANY DESCRIBED EXPERIENCING RELIEF DURING AND AFTER SESSIONS. SMS WROTE ON A WIDE RANGE OF TOPICS. MOST SMS KEPT THEIR WRITING PIECES, ALTHOUGH SOME DESTROYED THEM OR SHARED THEM WITH OTHERS, AND A FEW SMS GIFTED THE PIECES. COMPUTERIZED-BASED ANALYSIS (PENNEBAKER ET AL., 2015) INDICATED THAT WORK AND SOCIAL WERE THE MOST PROMINENT CONTENT THEME AREAS. IT ALSO SHOWED THAT POSITIVE EMOTIONS WERE MORE EVIDENT THAN NEGATIVE EMOTIONS IN THE CLINICAL NOTES AND THAT THE FOCUS OF THE WRITING PIECES WAS PRIMARILY ON THE PRESENT RATHER THAN ON THE PAST OR THE FUTURE. IMPLICATIONS: MANY SMS PERCEIVED THE THERAPEUTIC WRITING EXPERIENCE AS THERAPEUTIC, A RELEVANT COPING SKILL, AND ENJOYABLE. SOME, HOWEVER, PREFERRED TO WORK ON ART THERAPY PROJECTS THEY HAD BEGUN IN PREVIOUS SESSIONS (SUCH AS MASK-MAKING) DURING THE WRITING SESSIONS. THE COMPUTER-BASED ANALYSIS OF THE CLINICAL NOTES TOOK MUCH LESS TIME THAN THE HUMAN ANALYSIS, BUT IT DID NOT PRODUCE RESULTS OF COMPARABLE RICHNESS OR NUANCE.

PSYCHOLOGICAL CONCEPTS, SUCH AS NARRATIVE BREACH, GRICEAN MAXIMS, AND LEXICAL MARKING IN COGNITION, MAY ASSIST THE RECOVERY OF DISASTER-RELEVANT METRICS FROM ALTERED PATTERNS OF WORD PREVALENCE. METHOD WE ANALYZED SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND LOCATION-SPECIFIC MICROBLOGS FROM TWITTER FOR HURRICANE SANDY, OKLAHOMA TORNADOES, AND THE BOSTON MARATHON BOMBING ALONG WITH A FANTASY FOOTBALL CONTROL CORPUS, EXAMINING THE RELATIVE FREQUENCY OF WORDS IN 36 ANTONYM PAIRS. WE COMPARED THE RATIO OF WORDS WITHIN THESE PAIRS TO THE CORRESPONDING RATIOS RECOVERED FROM AN ONLINE WORD NORM DATABASE. RESULTS PARTIAL RANK CORRELATION VALUES BETWEEN OBSERVED ANTONYM RATIOS DEMONSTRATE CONSISTENT PATTERNS ACROSS DISASTERS. FOR HURRICANE SANDY DATA, 25 ANTONYM PAIRS HAVE MODERATE TO LARGE EFFECT SIZES FOR DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN OBSERVED AND NORMATIVE RATIOS. ACROSS DISASTERS, 7 PAIRS ARE STABLE AND MEET EFFECT SIZE CRITERIA. SENTIMENT ANALYSIS, SUPPLEMENTARY WORD FREQUENCY COUNTS WITH RESPECT TO DISASTER PROXIMITY, AND EXAMPLES SUPPORT A ""BREACH"" ACCOUNT FOR THE OBSERVED RESULTS. CONCLUSION LEXICAL CHOICE BETWEEN ANTONYMS, ONLY SOMEWHAT RELATED TO SENTIMENT, SUGGESTS THAT SOCIAL MEDIA CAPTURE WIDE-RANGING BREACHES OF NORMAL FUNCTIONING. APPLICATION ANTONYM SELECTION CONTRIBUTES TO SCREENING TOOLS BASED ON LANGUAGE STYLE FOR IDENTIFYING RELEVANT CONTENT AND QUANTIFYING DISRUPTION USING SOCIAL MEDIA WITHOUT THE A PRIORI SPECIFICATION OF CONTENT KEYWORDS.",1,1,1

WHERE LESS SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT CAN BE OBSERVED IS IN THE AREA OF SPONSORSHIP EVALUATION. THIS PAPER OUTLINES A SPECIFIC COMPANY CASE STUDY FOCUSING ON A RELATIVELY NEW, BUT NOW WELL-ESTABLISHED BRAND, WHICH MADE A SIGNIFICANT STRATEGIC CHOICE IN UTILIZING SPONSORSHIP FOR BRAND BUILDING, MARKET PENETRATION, AND THE ACQUISITION AND RETENTION OF CONSUMERS IN AN INCREASINGLY COMMODIFIED SERVICE CATEGORY IN CONTRAST TO THE STRATEGIC MIX CHOSEN BY ITS MAIN COMPETITORS. THE PAPER PROVIDES A DETAILED FOCUS ON THE MANAGEMENT AND EVALUATION OF THEIR SPONSORSHIP ACTIVITY IN ONE PARTICULAR MARKET. FOLLOWING A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO THE O2 BRAND AND ITS INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT, IT WILL EXAMINE THE BRANDS POSITION IN THE IRISH MARKETPLACE AND THE STRATEGICALLY CHOSEN ROLE FOR SPONSORSHIP IN ITS ARMORY OF MARKETING OPTIONS. IT DETAILS THE KEY STRATEGIC PILLARS, WHICH UNDERPIN THE APPROACH TO SPONSORSHIP AS A SET OF BELIEFS THAT HOLD SPONSORSHIP POLICY AND ACTIVATION TOGETHER. THE CHALLENGE, IN A MATURE MARKET DOMINATED BY COMPETITION FOR MARKET SHARE, WAS TO DRIVE SHORT-TERM SALES WHILE BUILDING LONG-TERM BRAND EQUITY. THE INDUSTRY WAS EXPERIENCING A PARADIGM SHIFT FROM 'MOBILE OPERATORS' TO 'SOCIAL NETWORKS' AND THE PAPER EXPLAINS HOW THE CHOICE AND ACTIVATION OF SPONSORSHIPS SOUGHT TO DEVELOP PARTICIPATIVE INTERACTION WITH CUSTOMERS TO PROMOTE EMOTIONALLY DRIVEN LOYALTY. TO MAKE THE BRAND THE BASIS FOR DIFFERENTIATION THE COMPANY CHOSE A MARKETING MIX WEIGHTED TOWARD SPONSORSHIP AND PLACED 'PARTICIPATION' AT THE CORE OF ACTIVATION. THE STRATEGIC CHOICES INVOLVED REGARDING THE BALANCE OF RESOURCES BETWEEN PAID-FOR MEDIA AND SPONSORSHIP AND IN THE LATTER CASE, BETWEEN ASSETS AND ACTIVATION, ARE EXPLORED. TWO CASE STUDIES RELATING TO SPORT AND ENTERTAINMENT SPONSORSHIP ARE DETAILED WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO INNOVATIVE AND CREATIVE ACTIVATION THROUGH SOCIAL NETWORKS. THE PAPER WILL OUTLINE THE USE OF QUANTITATIVE TRACKING MEASURES AS WELL AS MORE INVOLVED MEASURES IN EVALUATING SPONSORSHIP PERFORMANCE. MORE SPECIFICALLY IT WILL FOCUS ON THE MEASUREMENT OF SPONSORSHIP PERFORMANCE AND IN PARTICULAR ON THE VARIOUS POINTS AT WHICH MEASUREMENT IS BROUGHT TO BEAR AND THE RANGE OF METRICSINCLUDING SOFTER MEASURES SUCH AS SENTIMENT ANALYSIS AND SOCIAL MEDIA CONVERSATIONSUTILIZED IN THIS EVALUATION PROCESS.

WITH THE EXTENSIVE DIGITALIZATION OF MEDICAL INFORMATION GLOBALLY AND INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF UNDERSTANDING AND MINING BIG DATA IN THE MEDICAL FIELD, NLP IS BECOMING MORE CRUCIAL. OBJECTIVE: THE GOAL OF THE RESEARCH WAS TO PERFORM A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW ON THE USE OF NLP IN MEDICAL RESEARCH WITH THE AIM OF UNDERSTANDING THE GLOBAL PROGRESS ON NLP RESEARCH OUTCOMES, CONTENT, METHODS, AND STUDY GROUPS INVOLVED. METHODS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED USING THE PUBMED DATABASE AS A SEARCH PLATFORM. ALL PUBLISHED STUDIES ON THE APPLICATION OF NLP IN MEDICINE (EXCEPT BIOMEDICINE) DURING THE 20 YEARS BETWEEN 1999 AND 2018 WERE RETRIEVED. THE DATA OBTAINED FROM THESE PUBLISHED STUDIES WERE CLEANED AND STRUCTURED. EXCEL (MICROSOFT CORP) AND VOSVIEWER (NEES JAN VAN ECK AND LUDO WALTMAN) WERE USED TO PERFORM BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF PUBLICATION TRENDS, AUTHOR ORDERS, COUNTRIES, INSTITUTIONS, COLLABORATION RELATIONSHIPS, RESEARCH HOT SPOTS, DISEASES STUDIED, AND RESEARCH METHODS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 3498 ARTICLES WERE OBTAINED DURING INITIAL SCREENING, AND 2336 ARTICLES WERE FOUND TO MEET THE STUDY CRITERIA AFTER MANUAL SCREENING. THE NUMBER OF PUBLICATIONS INCREASED EVERY YEAR, WITH A SIGNIFICANT GROWTH AFTER 2012 (NUMBER OF PUBLICATIONS RANGED FROM 148 TO A MAXIMUM OF 302 ANNUALLY). THE UNITED STATES HAS OCCUPIED THE LEADING POSITION SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE FIELD, WITH THE LARGEST NUMBER OF ARTICLES PUBLISHED. THE UNITED STATES CONTRIBUTED TO 63.01% (1472/2336) OF ALL PUBLICATIONS, FOLLOWED BY FRANCE (5.44%, 127/2336) AND THE UNITED KINGDOM (3.51%, 82/2336). THE AUTHOR WITH THE LARGEST NUMBER OF ARTICLES PUBLISHED WAS HONGFANG LIU (70), WHILE STEPHANE MEYSTRE (17) AND HUA XU (33) PUBLISHED THE LARGEST NUMBER OF ARTICLES AS THE FIRST AND CORRESPONDING AUTHORS. AMONG THE FIRST AUTHOR'S AFFILIATION INSTITUTION, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY PUBLISHED THE LARGEST NUMBER OF ARTICLES, ACCOUNTING FOR 4.54% (106/2336) OF THE TOTAL. SPECIFICALLY, APPROXIMATELY ONE-FIFTH (17.68%, 413/2336) OF THE ARTICLES INVOLVED RESEARCH ON SPECIFIC DISEASES, AND THE SUBJECT AREAS PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON MENTAL ILLNESS (16.46%, 68/413), BREAST CANCER (5.81%, 24/413), AND PNEUMONIA (4.12%, 17/413). CONCLUSIONS: NLP IS IN A PERIOD OF ROBUST DEVELOPMENT IN THE MEDICAL FIELD, WITH AN AVERAGE OF APPROXIMATELY 100 PUBLICATIONS ANNUALLY. ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS WERE THE MOST USED RESEARCH MATERIALS, BUT SOCIAL MEDIA SUCH AS TWITTER HAVE BECOME IMPORTANT RESEARCH MATERIALS SINCE 2015. CANCER (24.94%, 103/413) WAS THE MOST COMMON SUBJECT AREA IN NLP-ASSISTED MEDICAL RESEARCH ON DISEASES, WITH BREAST CANCERS (23.30%, 24/103) AND LUNG CANCERS (14.56%, 15/103) ACCOUNTING FOR THE HIGHEST PROPORTIONS OF STUDIES.

METHODS: RESEARCHERS UTILIZED USER-GENERATED CONTENT ON INSPIRE, LOOKING AT OVER 11 MILLION POSTS ACROSS INSPIRE. POSTS WERE WRITTEN BY PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS BELONGING TO A VARIETY OF COMMUNITIES ON INSPIRE. AFTER IDENTIFYING THESE POSTS, RESEARCHERS USED NLP AND HANDS-ON LINGUISTIC ANALYSIS TO DRAW AND EXPAND UPON CORRELATIONS AMONG STATIN USE, MEMORY, AND COGNITION. RESULTS: NLP ANALYSIS OF POSTS IDENTIFIED STATISTICAL CORRELATIONS BETWEEN STATIN USERS AND THE DISCUSSION OF MEMORY IMPAIRMENT, WHICH WERE NOT OBSERVED IN CONTROL GROUPS.

OBJECTIVE: WE EXPANDED OUR PREVIOUS WORK BY INVESTIGATING NEWS MEDIA DATA TO REVEAL THE COVERAGE OF DIFFERENT DISEASES AND MEDICAL CONDITIONS, TOGETHER WITH THEIR SENTIMENTS AND TOPICS IN NEWS ARTICLES OVER THREE DECADES. WE WERE MOTIVATED TO DO SO SINCE NEWS MEDIA PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN POLITICS AND AFFECTS THE PUBLIC POLICY MAKING. METHODS: WE ANALYZED OVER 3.5 MILLION ARCHIVE NEWS ARTICLES FROM REUTERS MEDIA DURING THE PERIODS OF 1996/1997, 2008 AND 2016, USING SUMMARY STATISTICS, SENTIMENT ANALYSIS, AND TOPIC MODELING. SUMMARY STATISTICS ILLUSTRATED THE COVERAGE OF VARIOUS DISEASES AND MEDICAL CONDITIONS DURING THE LAST 3 DECADES. SENTIMENT ANALYSIS AND TOPIC MODELING HELPED US AUTOMATICALLY DETECT THE SENTIMENTS OF NEWS ARTICLES (IE, POSITIVE VERSUS NEGATIVE) AND TOPICS (IE, A SERIES OF KEYWORDS) ASSOCIATED WITH EACH DISEASE OVER TIME. RESULTS: THE PERCENTAGES OF NEWS ARTICLES MENTIONING DISEASES AND MEDICAL CONDITIONS WERE 0.44%, 0.57% AND 0.81% IN THE THREE TIME PERIODS, SUGGESTING THAT NEWS MEDIA OR THE PUBLIC HAS GRADUALLY INCREASED ITS INTERESTS IN MEDICINE SINCE 1996. CERTAIN DISEASES SUCH AS OTHER MALIGNANT NEOPLASM (34%), OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES (20%), AND INFLUENZA (11%) REPRESENTED THE MOST COVERED DISEASES. TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SIX DISEASES AND MEDICAL CONDITIONS (97.8%) WERE FOUND TO HAVE NEUTRAL OR NEGATIVE SENTIMENTS IN THE NEWS ARTICLES. USING TOPIC MODELING, WE IDENTIFIED MEANINGFUL TOPICS ON THESE DISEASES AND MEDICAL CONDITIONS.

OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO MEASURE HOW COMMON TIMING AND LOCATION CONFOUNDERS EXPLAIN VARIATION IN SENTIMENT ON TWITTER. METHODS: USING A DATASET OF 16.54 MILLION ENGLISH-LANGUAGE TWEETS FROM 100 CITIES POSTED BETWEEN JULY 13 AND NOVEMBER 30, 2017, WE ESTIMATED THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SENTIMENT FOR EACH OF THE CITIES USING A DICTIONARY-BASED SENTIMENT ANALYSIS AND CONSTRUCTED MODELS TO EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCES IN SENTIMENT USING TIME OF DAY, DAY OF WEEK, WEATHER, CITY, AND INTERACTION TYPE (CONVERSATIONS OR BROADCASTING) AS FACTORS AND FOUND THAT ALL FACTORS WERE INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH SENTIMENT. RESULTS: IN THE FULL MULTIVARIABLE MODEL OF POSITIVE (PEARSON R IN TEST DATA 0.236; 95% CI 0.231-0.241) AND NEGATIVE (PEARSON R IN TEST DATA 0.306; 95% CI 0.301-0.310) SENTIMENT, THE CITY AND TIME OF DAY EXPLAINED MORE OF THE VARIANCE THAN WEATHER AND DAY OF WEEK.

METHODS: TO ADDRESS THIS QUESTION, THE PRESENT STUDY USED A PROSPECTIVE, LONGITUDINAL DESIGN TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF MOOD-INCONGRUENT PROCESSING IN A SAMPLE OF 59 CLINICALLY DEPRESSED PATIENTS. AT BASELINE, PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED TO RECALL AND DESCRIBE A SAD AND A HAPPY LIFE EVENT. PARTICIPANTS' UTTERANCES WERE TRANSCRIBED AND ANALYSED USING COMPUTERIZED TEXT ANALYSIS. NEGATED EMOTION WORDS WERE EXCLUDED. THE PROPORTION OF POSITIVE EMOTION WORDS DURING SAD MEMORY RECALL WAS USED AS AN INDICATOR OF MOOD-INCONGRUENT PROCESSING. AFTER 6 MONTHS, PARTICIPANTS WERE RE-ASSESSED FOR SYMPTOM LEVELS AND THE CRITERIA OF MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (MDD) DURING THE FOLLOW-UP PERIOD. RESULTS: HIGHER RELATIVE FREQUENCY OF POSITIVE EMOTION WORDS DURING SAD MEMORY RECALL WAS ASSOCIATED WITH LESS SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION AT FOLLOW-UP AND SHORTER TIME TO RECOVERY FROM MDD, OVER AND ABOVE BASELINE SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION. THE EFFECT WAS NOT JUST DUE TO INCREASED GENERAL POSITIVITY IN EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION OR EMOTIONAL EXPRESSIVENESS PER SE. LIMITATIONS: THE SAMPLE SIZE AND THE TIMEFRAME FOR THE FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENT WERE LIMITED. FURTHERMORE, IT IS UNKNOWN TO WHICH DEGREE WORD USE REFLECTS THE ACTUAL EXPERIENCE OF THE EXPRESSED EMOTIONS.

PATIENTS WITH EDNOS-ONLY WERE IDENTIFIED USING ICD-9 CODE (307.50) AND THOSE WITH NLP-IDENTIFIED BED WERE EXCLUDED. FIRST DIAGNOSIS DATE DEFINED THE INDEX DATE FOR BOTH GROUPS. PATIENTS WITH NED WERE RANDOMLY MATCHED 4:1, AS AVAILABLE, TO PATIENTS WITH BED ON AGE, SEX, BMI, DEPRESSION DIAGNOSIS, AND INDEX MONTH. PATIENTS WITH COST DATA (2005-2011) WERE INCLUDED. TOTAL HEALTHCARE, INPATIENT, OUTPATIENT, AND PHARMACY COSTS WERE EXAMINED. GENERALIZED LINEAR MODELS WERE USED TO COMPARE TOTAL ONE-YEAR HEALTHCARE COSTS WHILE ADJUSTING FOR BASELINE PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS. RESULTS: THERE WERE 257 BED, 743 EDNOS-ONLY, AND 823 MATCHED NED PATIENTS IDENTIFIED. THE MEAN (SD) TOTAL UNADJUSTED ONE-YEAR COSTS, IN 2011 US DOLLARS, WERE $33,716 ($38,928) FOR BED, $37,052 ($40,719) FOR EDNOS-ONLY, AND $19,548 ($35,780) FOR NED PATIENTS. WHEN ADJUSTING FOR PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS, BED PATIENTS HAD ONE-YEAR TOTAL HEALTHCARE COSTS $5,589 HIGHER THAN EDNOS-ONLY (P=0.06) AND $18,152 HIGHER THAN MATCHED NED PATIENTS (P<0.001). DISCUSSION: THIS STUDY IS THE FIRST TO USE NLP TO IDENTIFY BED PATIENTS AND QUANTIFY THEIR HEALTHCARE COSTS AND UTILIZATION. PATIENTS WITH BED HAD SIMILAR ONE-YEAR TOTAL HEALTHCARE COSTS TO EDNOS-ONLY PATIENTS, BUT SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER COSTS THAN PATIENTS WITH NED.",1,1,1

THE FIRST APPROACH ADOPTED IN THIS STUDY WAS CALCULATING THE IMPORTANT DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS OF MOOC-RELATED TWEETS AND EXAMINING THE DAILY, WEEKLY, AND MONTHLY TRENDS OF MOOC THAT APPEARED ON TWITTER. THIS INFORMATION CAN ENABLE MOOC PRACTITIONERS TO OBSERVE PARTICIPANTS TEMPORAL ACTIVITIES ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND ASCERTAIN THE MOST EFFECTIVE TIME TO POST OR ANALYZE TWEETS. SECONDLY, WE INVESTIGATED HOW PUBLIC SENTIMENT TOWARD MOOC LEARNING CAN BE ASSESSED ACCORDING TO RELATED TWEETS. BECAUSE THE AVAILABILITY AND POPULARITY OF OPINION-RICH SOCIAL NETWORKING SERVICES ARE INCREASING FOR MOOC COMMUNITIES, OUR FINDINGS FROM THE SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF TWITTER DATA CAN AFFORD SUBSTANTIAL INSIGHTS INTO PARTICIPANT PERCEPTIONS OF MOOC LEARNING.

ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS (EMRS) HAVE RECENTLY EMERGED AS A POWERFUL NEW SOURCE OF INFORMATION FOR DEFINING THE PHENOTYPIC SIGNATURES OF SPECIFIC DISEASES. WE INVESTIGATED HOW EMR-BASED TEXT MINING AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS COULD ELUCIDATE THE PHENOTYPIC BOUNDARIES OF THREE IMPORTANT NEUROPSYCHIATRIC ILLNESSES-AUTISM, BIPOLAR DISORDER, AND SCHIZOPHRENIA. METHODS: WE ANALYZED THE MEDICAL RECORDS OF OVER 7000 PATIENTS AT TWO FACILITIES USING AN AUTOMATED TEXT-PROCESSING PIPELINE TO ANNOTATE THE CLINICAL NOTES WITH UNIFIED MEDICAL LANGUAGE SYSTEM CODES AND THEN SEARCHING FOR ENRICHED CODES, AND ASSOCIATIONS AMONG CODES, THAT WERE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE THREE DISORDERS. WE USED DIMENSIONALITY-REDUCTION TECHNIQUES ON INDIVIDUAL PATIENT RECORDS TO UNDERSTAND INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL PHENOTYPIC VARIATION WITHIN EACH DISORDER, AS WELL AS THE DEGREE OF OVERLAP AMONG DISORDERS. RESULTS: WE DEMONSTRATE THAT AUTOMATED EMR MINING CAN BE USED TO EXTRACT RELEVANT DRUGS AND PHENOTYPES ASSOCIATED WITH NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS AND CHARACTERISTIC PATTERNS OF ASSOCIATIONS AMONG THEM. PATIENT-LEVEL ANALYSES SUGGEST A CLEAR SEPARATION BETWEEN AUTISM AND THE OTHER DISORDERS, WHILE REVEALING SIGNIFICANT OVERLAP BETWEEN SCHIZOPHRENIA AND BIPOLAR DISORDER.

SEARCH TERMS ARE BASED ON THE DRUG USE ONTOLOGY (DAO) CREATED FOR THIS STUDY (189 SCRA-RELATED AND 501 EFFECT-RELATED TERMS). EDRUGTRENDS NLP-BASED TEXT PROCESSING TOOLS WERE USED TO EXTRACT POSTS MENTIONING SCRA AND THEIR EFFECTS. GENERALIZED LINEAR REGRESSION WAS USED TO FIT RESTRICTED CUBIC SPLINE FUNCTIONS OF TIME TO TEST WHETHER THE PROPORTION OF DRUG-RELATED POSTS THAT MENTION SCRA (AND NO OTHER DRUG) AND THE PROPORTION OF THESE 'SCRA-ONLY' POSTS THAT MENTION SCRA EFFECTS HAVE CHANGED OVER TIME, WITH AN ADJUSTMENT FOR MULTIPLE TESTING. RESULTS: 19,052 SCRA-RELATED POSTS (BLUELIGHT (N = 2782), FORUM A (N = 3882), AND FORUM B (N = 12,388)) POSTED BY 2543 INTERNATIONAL USERS WERE EXTRACTED. THE MOST FREQUENTLY MENTIONED EFFECTS WERE 'GETTING HIGH' (44.0%), 'HALLUCINATIONS' (10.8%), AND 'ANXIETY' (10.2%). THE FREQUENCY OF SCRA-ONLY POSTS DECLINED STEADILY OVER THE STUDY PERIOD. THE PROPORTIONS OF SCRA-ONLY POSTS MENTIONING POSITIVE EFFECTS (E.G., 'HIGH' AND 'EUPHORIA') STEADILY DECREASED, WHILE THE PROPORTIONS OF SCRA-ONLY POSTS MENTIONING NEGATIVE EFFECTS (E.G., 'ANXIETY,' NAUSEA,' 'OVERDOSE') INCREASED OVER THE SAME PERIOD. CONCLUSION: THIS STUDYS FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THE PROPORTION OF NEGATIVE EFFECTS MENTIONED IN WEB FORUM POSTS AND LINKED TO SCRA HAS INCREASED OVER TIME, SUGGESTING THAT RECENT GENERATIONS OF SCRA GENERATE MORE HARMS.

HOWEVER, QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS IS A LABORIOUS AND RESOURCE-INTENSIVE PROCESS. TO ACHIEVE DEPTH, RESEARCHERS ARE LIMITED TO SMALLER SAMPLE SIZES WHEN ANALYZING TEXT DATA. ONE POTENTIAL METHOD TO ADDRESS THIS CONCERN IS NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP).

UNFORTUNATELY, LITTLE METHODOLOGICAL RESEARCH HAS BEEN DONE TO COMPARE AUTOMATIC CODING USING NLP TECHNIQUES AND QUALITATIVE CODING, WHICH IS CRITICAL TO ESTABLISH THE VIABILITY OF NLP AS A USEFUL, RIGOROUS ANALYSIS PROCEDURE. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COMPARE THE UTILITY OF A TRADITIONAL QUALITATIVE TEXT ANALYSIS, AN NLP ANALYSIS, AND AN AUGMENTED APPROACH THAT COMBINES QUALITATIVE AND NLP METHODS. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A 2-ARM CROSS-OVER EXPERIMENT TO COMPARE QUALITATIVE AND NLP APPROACHES TO ANALYZE DATA GENERATED THROUGH 2 TEXT (SHORT MESSAGE SERVICE) MESSAGE SURVEY QUESTIONS, ONE ABOUT PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND THE OTHER ABOUT POLICE INTERACTIONS, SENT TO YOUTH AGED 14-24 YEARS. WE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED A QUESTION TO EACH OF THE 2 EXPERIENCED QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS TEAMS FOR INDEPENDENT CODING AND ANALYSIS BEFORE RECEIVING NLP RESULTS. A THIRD TEAM SEPARATELY CONDUCTED NLP ANALYSIS OF THE SAME 2 QUESTIONS. WE EXAMINED THE RESULTS OF OUR ANALYSES TO COMPARE (1) THE SIMILARITY OF FINDINGS DERIVED, (2) THE QUALITY OF INFERENCES GENERATED, AND (3) THE TIME SPENT IN ANALYSIS. RESULTS: THE QUALITATIVE-ONLY ANALYSIS FOR THE DRUG QUESTION (N = 58) YIELDED 4 MAJOR FINDINGS, WHEREAS THE NLP ANALYSIS YIELDED 3 FINDINGS THAT MISSED CONTEXTUAL ELEMENTS. THE QUALITATIVE AND NLP-AUGMENTED ANALYSIS WAS THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE. FOR THE POLICE QUESTION (N = 68), THE QUALITATIVE-ONLY ANALYSIS YIELDED 4 PRIMARY FINDINGS AND THE NLP-ONLY ANALYSIS YIELDED 4 SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FINDINGS. AGAIN, THE AUGMENTED QUALITATIVE AND NLP ANALYSIS WAS THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE AND PRODUCED THE HIGHEST QUALITY INFERENCES, INCREASING OUR DEPTH OF UNDERSTANDING (IE, DETAILS AND FREQUENCIES). IN TERMS OF TIME, THE NLP-ONLY APPROACH WAS QUICKER THAN THE QUALITATIVE-ONLY APPROACH FOR THE DRUG (120 VS 270 MINUTES) AND POLICE (40 VS 270 MINUTES) QUESTIONS. AN APPROACH BEGINNING WITH QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS FOLLOWED BY QUALITATIVE- OR NLP-AUGMENTED ANALYSIS TOOK LONGER TIME THAN THAT BEGINNING WITH NLP FOR BOTH DRUG (450 VS 240 MINUTES) AND POLICE (390 VS 220 MINUTES) QUESTIONS.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DEVELOP AND EVALUATE AN AUTOMATED TEXT-MINING SYSTEM THAT COULD DETERMINE THE EVIDENCE LEVEL PROVIDED BY A MEDICAL ARTICLE. METHODS: A TEXT PROCESSOR WAS DESIGNED AND BUILT TO INTERPRET THE ABSTRACTS OF MEDICAL LITERATURE. THE SYSTEM EXTRACTED INFORMATION ABOUT: (1) THE IMPACT FACTOR OF THE JOURNAL; (2) STUDY DESIGN; (3) HUMAN SUBJECT INVOLVEMENT; (4) NUMBER OF SUBJECTS; (5) P-VALUE; AND (6) CONFIDENCE INTERVALS. WE USED A CLASSIFICATION TREE ALGORITHM (C4.5) TO CREATE A DECISION TREE USING SUPERVISED CLASSIFICATION. EACH ARTICLE WAS CATEGORIZED INTO EVIDENCE LEVEL A, B OR C, AND THE OUTPUT WAS COMPARED TO THAT DETERMINED BY DOMAIN EXPERTS (THE REFERENCE STANDARD). RESULTS: WE USED A CORPUS OF 3180 CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE ORIGINAL RESEARCH ARTICLES, OF WHICH 1108 WERE PREVIOUSLY ASSIGNED EVIDENCE LEVEL A, 1705 LEVEL B AND 367 LEVEL C BY DOMAIN EXPERTS. THE ABSTRACTS WERE ANALYSED BY OUR AUTOMATED SYSTEM AND AN EVIDENCE LEVEL WAS ASSIGNED. THE ALGORITHM ACCURATELY CLASSIFIED 85% OF THE ARTICLES. THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN COMPUTER AND DOMAIN EXPERTS WAS SUBSTANTIAL (-VALUE: 0.78). CROSS-VALIDATION SHOWED CONSISTENT RESULTS ACROSS REPEATED TESTS. CONCLUSION: THE AUTOMATED ENGINE ACCURATELY CLASSIFIED THE EVIDENCE LEVEL. MISCLASSIFICATION MIGHT HAVE RESULTED FROM INCOMPLETE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL AND INACCURATE DATA EXTRACTION. FURTHER EFFORTS WILL FOCUS ON ASSESSING RELEVANCE AND USING ADDITIONAL STUDY DESIGN FEATURES TO REFINE EVIDENCE LEVEL CLASSIFICATION.

A COMBINATION OF MACHINE LEARNING (C4.5) USING SIDE EFFECT KEYWORD FEATURES AND PATTERN MATCHING RULES WAS USED TO EXTRACT SENTENCES THAT CONTAIN SIDE EFFECT AND CAUSATIVE DRUG PAIRS, ENABLING THE SYSTEM TO DISCOVER MOST SIDE EFFECT OCCURRENCES. OUR SYSTEM WAS IMPLEMENTED AS A MODULE WITHIN THE CLINICAL TEXT ANALYSIS AND KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION SYSTEM. RESULTS: THE SYSTEM WAS TESTED IN THE DOMAIN OF PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHOLOGY. THE RULE-BASED SYSTEM EXTRACTING SIDE EFFECTS AND CAUSATIVE DRUGS PRODUCED AN F SCORE OF 0.80 (0.55 EXCLUDING ALLERGY SECTION). THE HYBRID SYSTEM IDENTIFYING SIDE EFFECT SENTENCES HAD AN F SCORE OF 0.75 (0.56 EXCLUDING ALLERGY SECTION) BUT COVERED MORE SIDE EFFECT AND CAUSATIVE DRUG PAIRS THAN INDIVIDUAL SIDE EFFECT EXTRACTION. DISCUSSION: THE RULE-BASED SYSTEM WAS ABLE TO IDENTIFY MOST SIDE EFFECTS EXPRESSED BY CLEAR INDICATION WORDS. MORE SOPHISTICATED SEMANTIC PROCESSING IS REQUIRED TO HANDLE COMPLEX SIDE EFFECT DESCRIPTIONS IN THE NARRATIVE. WE DEMONSTRATED THAT OUR SYSTEM CAN BE TRAINED TO IDENTIFY SENTENCES WITH COMPLEX SIDE EFFECT DESCRIPTIONS THAT CAN BE SUBMITTED TO A HUMAN EXPERT FOR FURTHER ABSTRACTION.

OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DEVELOP A PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ONTOLOGY (PACO) TO SUPPORT STRUCTURING AND STANDARDIZING HETEROGENEOUS DESCRIPTIONS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES. METHODS: WE PREPARED A CORPUS OF 1140 UNIQUE SENTENCES COLLECTED FROM VARIOUS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY QUESTIONNAIRES AND SCALES AS WELL AS EXISTING STANDARDIZED TERMINOLOGIES AND ONTOLOGIES. WE EXTRACTED CONCEPTS RELEVANT TO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FROM THE CORPUS USING A NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TOOLKIT CALLED MULTIPURPOSE TEXT PROCESSING TOOL. THE TARGET CONCEPTS WERE FORMALIZED INTO AN ONTOLOGY USING PROTG (VERSION 4). EVALUATION OF PACO WAS PERFORMED TO ENSURE LOGICAL AND STRUCTURAL CONSISTENCY AS WELL AS ADHERENCE TO THE BEST PRACTICE PRINCIPLES OF BUILDING AN ONTOLOGY. A USE CASE APPLICATION OF PACO WAS DEMONSTRATED BY STRUCTURING AND STANDARDIZING 36 EXERCISE HABIT STATEMENTS AND THEN AUTOMATICALLY CLASSIFYING THEM TO A DEFINED CLASS OF EITHER SUFFICIENTLY ACTIVE OR INSUFFICIENTLY ACTIVE USING FACT++, AN ONTOLOGY REASONER AVAILABLE IN PROTG.

METHODS: A METHOD OF TEXT MINING WAS PERFORMED TO SELECT KEYWORDS, REPRESENTING THE CONTEXT OF THE TARGET DOCUMENTS, FROM ARTICLES RELEVANT TO THE PROMOTION OF HPV VACCINATION APPEARING IN MAJOR JAPANESE NEWSPAPERS AND WEB PAGES BETWEEN JANUARY 2009 AND JULY 2010. THE SELECTED KEYWORDS WERE CLASSIFIED AS POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, OR NEUTRAL, AND THE TRANSITION OF THE FREQUENCY OF THEIR APPEARANCE WAS ANALYZED. RESULTS: THE NUMBER OF POSITIVE AND NEUTRAL KEYWORDS APPEARING IN NEWSPAPER ARTICLES INCREASED SHARPLY IN EARLY 2010 WHILE THE NUMBER OF NEGATIVE KEYWORDS REMAINED LOW. THE NUMBERS OF POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, AND NEGATIVE KEYWORDS APPEARING IN WEB PAGES INCREASED GRADUALLY AND DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFER BY CATEGORY.

OBJECTIVE: OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF TRADITIONAL PIPELINES (NLP PLUS SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING MODELS) WITH THAT OF WORD EMBEDDING COMBINED WITH A CNN IN CONDUCTING A CLASSIFICATION TASK IDENTIFYING INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES, TENTH REVISION, CLINICAL MODIFICATION (ICD-10-CM) DIAGNOSIS CODES IN DISCHARGE NOTES. METHODS: WE USED 2 CLASSIFICATION METHODS: (1) EXTRACTING FROM DISCHARGE NOTES SOME FEATURES (TERMS, N-GRAM PHRASES, AND SNOMED CT CATEGORIES) THAT WE USED TO TRAIN A SET OF SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING MODELS (SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE, RANDOM FORESTS, AND GRADIENT BOOSTING MACHINE), AND (2) BUILDING A FEATURE MATRIX, BY A PRETRAINED WORD EMBEDDING MODEL, THAT WE USED TO TRAIN A CNN. WE USED THESE METHODS TO IDENTIFY THE CHAPTER-LEVEL ICD-10-CM DIAGNOSIS CODES IN A SET OF DISCHARGE NOTES. WE CONDUCTED THE EVALUATION USING 103,390 DISCHARGE NOTES COVERING PATIENTS HOSPITALIZED FROM JUNE 1, 2015 TO JANUARY 31, 2017 IN THE TRI-SERVICE GENERAL HOSPITAL IN TAIPEI, TAIWAN. WE USED THE RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC CURVE AS AN EVALUATION MEASURE, AND CALCULATED THE AREA UNDER THE CURVE (AUC) AND F-MEASURE AS THE GLOBAL MEASURE OF EFFECTIVENESS. RESULTS: IN 5-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION TESTS, OUR METHOD HAD A HIGHER TESTING ACCURACY (MEAN AUC 0.9696; MEAN F-MEASURE 0.9086) THAN TRADITIONAL NLP-BASED APPROACHES (MEAN AUC RANGE 0.8183-0.9571; MEAN F-MEASURE RANGE 0.5050-0.8739). A REAL-WORLD SIMULATION THAT SPLIT THE TRAINING SAMPLE AND THE TESTING SAMPLE BY DATE VERIFIED THIS RESULT (MEAN AUC 0.9645; MEAN F-MEASURE 0.9003 USING THE PROPOSED METHOD). FURTHER ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE CONVOLUTIONAL LAYERS OF THE CNN EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFIED A LARGE NUMBER OF KEYWORDS AND AUTOMATICALLY EXTRACTED ENOUGH CONCEPTS TO PREDICT THE DIAGNOSIS CODES.

MOTIVATED BY THE SUCCESS OF CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNNS) IN CLASSIFICATION TASKS, WE STUDIED THE APPLICATION OF VARIOUS CNN ARCHITECTURES AND THEIR PERFORMANCE IN PREDICTING THE SEVERITY OF POSITIVE VALENCE SYMPTOMS IN PATIENTS WITH PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS BASED ON INITIAL PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION RECORDS. METHODS: PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION RECORDS CONTAIN UNSTRUCTURED TEXT AND SEMI-STRUCTURED DATA SUCH AS QUESTION-ANSWER PAIRS. FOR A GIVEN RECORD, WE TOKENISE AND NORMALISE THE SEMI-STRUCTURED CONTENT. PRE-PROCESSED TOKENISED WORDS ARE REPRESENTED AS ONE-HOT ENCODED WORD VECTORS. WE THEN APPLY DIFFERENT CONFIGURATIONS OF CONVOLUTIONAL AND MAX POOLING LAYERS TO AUTOMATICALLY LEARN IMPORTANT FEATURES FROM VARIOUS WORD REPRESENTATIONS. WE CONDUCTED A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS TO EXPLORE THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT CNN ARCHITECTURES ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF PSYCHIATRIC RECORDS. RESULTS: OUR BEST CNN MODEL ACHIEVED A MEAN ABSOLUTE ERROR (MAE) OF 0.539 AND A NORMALIZED MAE OF 0.785 ON THE TEST DATASET, WHICH IS COMPARABLE TO THE OTHER WELL-KNOWN TEXT CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS STUDIED IN THIS WORK. OUR RESULTS ALSO SUGGEST THAT THE NORMALISATION STEP HAS A GREAT IMPACT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE DEVELOPED MODELS. CONCLUSIONS: WE DEMONSTRATE THAT NORMALISATION OF THE SEMI-STRUCTURED CONTENTS CAN IMPROVE THE MAE AMONG ALL CNN CONFIGURATIONS. WITHOUT ADVANCED FEATURE ENGINEERING, CNN-BASED APPROACHES CAN PROVIDE A COMPARABLE SOLUTION FOR CLASSIFYING POSITIVE VALENCE SYMPTOM SEVERITY IN INITIAL PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION RECORDS. ALTHOUGH WORD EMBEDDING IS WELL KNOWN FOR ITS ABILITY TO CAPTURE RELATIVELY LOW-DIMENSIONAL SIMILARITY BETWEEN WORDS, OUR EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT PRE-TRAINED EMBEDDINGS DO NOT IMPROVE THE CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE.
